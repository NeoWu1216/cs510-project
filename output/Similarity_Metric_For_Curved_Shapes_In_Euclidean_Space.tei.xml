<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this paper, we introduce a similarity metric for curved shapes that can be described, distinctively, by ordered points. The proposed method represents a given curve as a point in the deformation space, the direct product of rigid transformation matrices, such that the successive action of the matrices on a fixed starting point reconstructs the full curve. In general, both open and closed curves are represented in the deformation space modulo shape orientation and orientation preserving diffeomorphisms. The use of direct product Lie groups to represent curved shapes led to an explicit formula for geodesic curves and the formulation of a similarity metric between shapes by the L 2 -norm on the Lie algebra. Additionally, invariance to reparametrization or estimation of point correspondence between shapes is performed as an intermediate step for computing geodesics. Furthermore, since there is no computation of differential quantities on the curves, our representation is more robust to local perturbations and needs no pre-smoothing. We compare our method with the elastic shape metric defined through the square root velocity (SRV) mapping, and other shape matching approaches.</p><p>In the infinite dimensional setting, shape space is usually</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The analysis of the shape of an object has several applications in computer vision, engineering, computational anatomy, and bioinformatics <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. In fact, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> the practical importances of shape analysis and modelling were categorized as shape optimization: finding a shape that satisfies a certain design requirement, e.g. active contours, and shape analysis: statistical analysis of shapes, e.g. distance between shapes, mean shapes and probability distribution of shapes. Consequently, a significant effort has been made to describe shapes based on features or landmarks that satisfy predefined requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>. However, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> feature based approaches are argued to be inadequate to represent a shape; since, shape space in gen- <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Illustration of the proposed representation. Given the discrete path starts at point p 1 , the curve's representation is (ĝ 1 , · · · ,ĝ n−1 ), where theĝ's are rigid transformation matrices.</p><p>eral is formulated as non-linear and infinite dimensional space. Thus, theoretically, an infinite-dimensional object can not distinctively be represented by a finite-dimensional feature. For instance, landmark-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> require the landmark points to be selected either automatically or with expert's input. This leads to inconsistent representation, as the same shape can, potentially, be represented by two completely different sets of landmark points. In contrast, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> shapes were parametrized by functions. Thus, shape space is considered in its entirety as an infinite dimensional space. Moreover, the infinite dimensional space is complemented with a distance metric. Hence, in principle, shape space is framed as infinite dimensional Riemannian manifold. There are several advantages in using the Riemannian framework to define a shape space. The first advantage is the treatment of shape space as a smooth manifold which is only natural considering the non-linearity of shapes. Secondly, the Riemannian framework offers a smoothly varying metric, which is essential to measure distance, area and other associated geometric notions in the shape space. Furthermore, under the Riemannian framework, shape space can be linearised, at least locally, without disregarding the non-linear nature of shapes; effectively, opening shape analysis problems to statistical treatment. Consequently, several and different distance metrics were considered in infinite dimensional manifolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>given as Imm(S 1 , R n )/Diff(S 1 ), where Imm(S 1 , R n ) is the space of all parametrized functions immersed in R n and defined on a 1-dimensional circle, S 1 , while Diff(S 1 ) is the group of diffeomorphisms acting on S 1 . The most common metric in such a space is L 2 (a, b) = a, b ds, where a and b are vector fields tangent to a curve at the shape space and integrated with respect to the arc length. Although, this metric looks simple, its geodesic equation is difficult to solve. More ominously, the L 2 metric can potentially result in a zero distance between two different shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Consequently, to avoid such behaviour first order Sobolev metric was introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, with numerical solutions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, an isomorphism from Imm(S 1 , R n )/Diff(S 1 ), with first order Sobolev metric, to Hilbert manifold, with L 2 metric, was presented by a mapping function called square root velocity (SRV). As a result, the first order Sobolev metric was shown to be equivalent to L 2 metric on a Hilbert manifold for certain weighting constants. This led to a numerically efficient distance computation between shapes. Thus, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, geodesic paths were computed with a closedform formula for open curves. For closed curves, however, the geodesic distance is computed with an iterative method called "path-straightening". In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, a metric that leads to explicit geodesics of planar curves is presented. Nonetheless, in almost all parametrization approaches shapes are assumed to be C ∞ (infinitely differentiable) or at least C 2 , since most approaches need to compute curvature at some stage. In fact, most metrics in infinite dimensional space are defined based on differential quantities of the curve, e.g. first order Sobolev metric. This, in general, leads to representation which is sensitive to noise, making a presmoothing stage a necessity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Alternatively, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> the theme of taking optimal deformation between shapes as a similarity metric was introduced. In such a setting, a given shape is similar to another if it is a small deformation away. Hence, similarity and difference between shapes is quantified by the required deformation to align them. Although, the deformations need not be low-dimensional, e.g. rigid transformation, they can be tailored to fit a particular problem. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, for example, a high-dimensional deformation that does not include reflection was presented to capture variability in a 3-dimensional human body shape. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a general pattern theory that analyses patterns generated by geometric units ( e.g. points and lines) and their relationship based on transformations that act on the units is presented. In general, the optimal deformation approach gives a similarity metric that is robust to noise or outliers unlike other differential based metrics or Hausdorff distance (L ∞ ), for example. However, in most cases the computation of optimal deformation is numerically intensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we build on <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and formulate a new curved shape representation on the deformation space, which leads to a much simpler similarity metric that is equivalent to L 2norm. The proposed approach computes the optimal deformation as a similarity metric. Nonetheless, we do not only compute optimal deformation as a metric but explicitly represent the curves in the deformation space, which, in our case, is a finite dimensional Lie group. We also do not refer to a template shape to compute deformations which is the case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. To encode how a given curve is deforming through space, a curved shape is represented by finitely many rigid transformation matrices that are required to construct the whole curve from a given starting point, see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. In essence, the transformation matrices capture how the shape bends and stretches through space.</p><p>The key point of the approach is in using the already established Riemannian structure of the rigid transformation matrix space to compute distance and estimate point correspondence. Overall, the main advantage of our approach is the computation of geodesic distance between shapes by L 2 -norm; closed form solution for geodesic path between two shapes is possible. Furthermore, the similarity metric is relatively robust to local perturbations, and deformation of a shape can be factored with matrix manipulation. Although the proposed method is closer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, we will compare our results with <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, mainly because it has since been applied to a wide variety of problems.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we will formalize and discuss the proposed shape representation, definition of similarity metric and point correspondence estimation. In Section 3 experimental results of the proposed metric is reported. The paper ends with concluding remarks in Section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Shape representation</head><p>Assume a given curved shape S is distinctively described by a set of k discrete points uniformly sampled from the boundary of the shape. In practice, this is done by enforcing a roughly equal arc length between consecutive points, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Subsequently, similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, location and uniform scaling of a given shape, S = (p 1 , · · · , p k ) where p i ∈ R n , are filtered out as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S = (p * 1 , · · · , p * k ) = p 1 −p h , · · · , p k −p h ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>wherē</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p = 1 k k i p i ∈ R n , h = k i p i −p 2 2 ∈ R,</formula><p>where · 2 denotes L 2 -norm. Thus, any curved shape S is a point in R kn . Furthermore, the sampled points are assumed to be ordered according to arc length. The starting point p 1 and ordering direction of a path are selected arbitrarily. Later in the paper, we will discuss the impact of ordering direction and selection of starting point; this is similar to what was described as reparametrization in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. We further denote the space of k ordered and normalized points, using (1), by C. Subsequently, any curved shape S i ∈ C is assumed to be able to deform into any other shape S j ∈ C by a group action; i.e. α : G × C → C where G is a group. In this work, we will only consider Euclidean transformations without reflection and thus the group under consideration is the direct product of Special Euclidean group; i.e. G = SE(n) k . To that end, the deformation of a shape by group action is given as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">GS = (g 1 p 1 , · · · , g k p k ), where G ∋ G = (g 1 , · · · , g k ) such that g i ∈ SE(n).</formula><p>However, deformations that do not change the nature of the shape, e.g. rotation of a shape, are redundant and need to be filtered out. In addition, since scale and location are filtered out from S, we can restrict shape preserving deformations to a particular subgroup Q = {(q 1 , q 2 , · · · , q k ) ∈ SO(n) k | q 1 = q 2 · · · = q k }; here, SO(n) denotes the special orthogonal group. Consequently, the deformation of a given shape S j by any Q ∈ Q will define an equivalence class</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[S j ] in C. Thus, [S j ]</formula><p>is the set of all shapes that are generated by rotating S j . The key point of this paper, however, is in identifying a given shape S ∈ C by a group element G ∈ G, using the imposed order of points. More precisely, a mapping function is defined on C as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f (S) = Ĝ = (ĝ 1 , · · · ,ĝ k ) if S is a closed curvê G = (ĝ 1 , · · · ,ĝ k−1 ) if S is an open curve (2) such thatĝ i × p i = p i+1 .</formula><p>Given a staring reference point p 1 and an ordering direction, the inverse of the mapping function, for closed curves, is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">f −1 (Ĝ) = (p 1 ,ĝ 1 p 1 ,ĝ 2ĝ1 p 1 , · · · ,ĝ k · · ·ĝ 1 p 1 ). (3)</formula><p>The inverse for open curves can be defined similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Consequently, given a fixed starting point and ordering direction, any shape S ∈ C has a unique representation in G, see Appendix A on computing the optimal g ∈ SE(n) between two high dimensional points. Intuitively, f (·) employs the order of points to capture how a curved shape bends and stretches along the path starting from a fixed point. More importantly, f (·) preserves the shape equivalence relationship induced by rotating shapes.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Proposition 1. IfĜ a andĜ b are the representations of S a , S b ∈ [S j ] thenĜ a is equivalent toĜ b by conjugacy, G a ∼Ĝ b . Proof. Since, S a , S b ∈ [S j ] we can write S a = QS b where Q = (q 1 , · · · , q k ) ∈ Q. Let S a = (p a 1 , · · · , p a k ) and S b = (p b 1 , · · · , p b k ), then from (2) we havê g b i × p b i = p b i+1 = q i+1 × p a i+1 = q i+1 ×ĝ a i × p a i</formula><p>Since q 1 = q 2 = · · · = q k , we can compute elements ofĜ b in terms ofĜ a as followŝ</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">g b i × q i × p a i = q i+1 ×ĝ a i × p a î g b i = q i ×ĝ a i × q −1 i .</formula><p>Thus,Ĝ a andĜ b are equivalent by conjugacy, i.e.,Ĝ b = QĜ a Q −1</p><p>Although the above proof is done for closed curve representations, the argument is equally valid for open curve representations as well. Furthermore, given point correspondence between any two shapes, S a and S b , the optimal rotation Q, such that S a = QS b , can be computed by optimizing the following</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">min Q∈Q QS b − S a 2 2 .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In such a case, S a and S b are in the same shape class</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">if f (S b ) = Qf (S a )Q −1 .</formula><p>Computationally, if two given shapes belong to the same shape class then the corresponding eigenvalues of the transformation matrices in f (S b ) and f (S a ) are similar. In summary, closed and open curves are represented by elements of SE(n) k /Q and SE(n) k−1 /Q, respectively. At this stage, we are still assuming a given parametrization. Thus, neither SE(n) k /Q nor SE(n) k−1 /Q are invariant to reparametrization; we will address this issue later on the paper. However, it must be noted that SE(n) k is not a representation space exclusive to closed curves only-the representation space SE(n) k can potentially include open curves described by (k + 1) points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Distance in SE(n) k</head><p>The formulated shape representation space SE(n) k is a Lie group, thus is a non-linear space. As a result, the usual definition of shortest path as a straight line does not generalize to SE(n) k . In this subsection, we will provide an informal definition of Lie group, overview concepts from differential geometry and define distance in SE(n) and in the product group SE(n) k .</p><p>A Lie group is a differentiable or smooth manifold with a smooth group operations; that is, the group's binary operator (x, y) → xy −1 is smooth. Furthermore, the tangent space at the identity element e of a Lie group is an algebra called Lie algebra. Henceforth, we will denote the tangent space of a smooth manifold M at p ∈ M by T p M , e.g. the Lie algebra of SE(n) is denoted as T e M or se(n). Since a Lie group has a smooth invertible binary operator it can be anchored to any element a ∈ G so that it defines a diffeomorphism onto itself. For instance, the left translation of a Lie group defined as L a : G → aG. However, to compute distance, volume and other geometric notions, an additional structure called metric is needed. Subsequently, a differentiable manifold M complemented with a smoothly varying metric tensor q is called a Riemannian manifold (M, q); the metric tensor q is defined at the tangent space T p M as q p : T p M × T p M → R ≥0 for every p ∈ M , see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. As a result, the distance between A, B ∈ M is defined as Although, there are many curves that start at A and end at B the one that satisfies (5) is called geodesic curve. A Riemannian metric on a Lie group is said to be left translation invariant if the left translation diffeomorphism is an isometery, i.e., if the following is true</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">d(A, B) = Inf{ b a γ(t) T q tγ (t)dt},<label>(5)</label></formula><p>x, y e = dL a x, dL a y a , ∀x, y ∈ T e M, ∀a ∈ G, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> where dL a is the derivative of the left translation. In such a case, a left translation invariant Riemannian metric is identified with scalar product ·, · defined on the Lie algebra, se(n), through the pullback map, dL −1 a . More interestingly, if a vector fieldγ on a Lie group is left translation invariant, i.e., if the following is true forγ</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">(h) ∈ T h M dL aγ (h) =γ(ah) ∈ T ah M,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>then its integral curve γ(t) = exp(tγ) is geodesic. In a similar argument, a geodesic curve in SO(n) and R n can be defined, respectively, as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">β(t) = R 1 (R −1 1 R 2 ) t (8) α(t) = v 1 + (v 2 − v 1 )t,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where t ∈ [0, 1]. It can easily be checked that β(·) is geodesic in SO(n), though, not necessarily unique <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, whereas α(·) is clearly geodesic since R n is a vector space. Meanwhile, SE(n), which is not a compact group, is a semidirect product of a compact group, SO(n), and R n ; it can be represented in homogeneous coordinates as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">g i = R i v i 0 1 , s.t., R i ∈ SO(n), v i ∈ R n .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Consequently, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> the following curve in SE(n) is proven to be geodesic.</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">ϕ(t) = R 1 (R −1 1 R 2 ) t v 1 + (v 2 − v 1 )t 0 1 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where t ∈ [0, 1]. Subsequently, we can define a scalar product on the Lie algebra as</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(R 1 , v 1 ), (R 2 , v 2 ) = R 1 , R 2 + v 1 , v 2 ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where, R ∈ so(n), is the Lie algebra of SO(n). Thus, the length of a geodesic curve connecting g 1 , g 2 ∈ SE(n) can be computed by transporting the tangent vectors with the pullback to the Lie algebra. The geodesic distance, in this case, reads as</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">d(g 1 , g 2 ) = 1 0 dL −1 ϕ(t) (φ(t)), dL −1 ϕ(t) (φ(t)) dt,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where ·, · is as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Since ϕ(t) is a geodesic curve, the tangent vectorsφ(t) are parallel along ϕ(t).</p><p>Hence, the geodesic distance given in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(13)</ref> is reduced to the following</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">d(g 1 , g 2 ) = ( log(R T 1 R 2 ) 2 F + v 2 − v 1 2 2 ) 1/2 ,<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where · F denotes the Frobenius norm. At this stage, we can extend the geodesic curve <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> to the direct product space SE(n) k = SE(n) 1 × · · · × SE(n) k as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">ζ(Ĝ A ,Ĝ B ) = (ϕ(t) 1 , · · · , ϕ(t) k ),<label>(15)</label></formula><p>such that ϕ(t) i is the geodesic curve between g i ∈Ĝ A and g i ∈Ĝ B . It can be shown that (15) is a geodesic curve in the product group, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Subsequently, we can define the distance in SE(n) k , using the product metric, as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">d(Ĝ A ,Ĝ B ) = (d(ĝ 1 A ,ĝ 1 B ) 2 + · · · + d(ĝ k A ,ĝ k B ) 2 ) 1/2 .<label>(16)</label></formula><p>In effect, the geodesic path and distance between two shapes S A , S B ∈ C, represented byĜ A andĜ A , respectively, can be computed using <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref>, see Alg. 1, Alg. 2 and <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. We again stress that (16) is subject to point correspondence or parametrization.  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Shapes along the geodesic path between the first and the last shape which are the original input shapes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Properties of the metric</head><p>The proposed metric does not compute differential quantities of curved shapes. On the contrary, most infinite-dimensional representations compute differentials of the curve to define similarity metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Differentials, especially higher derivatives, are highly sensitive to noise and local perturbations. As a result, differential based approaches pre-smooth the input curves before processing it while incurring loss of potentially informative data. For instance, legitimate features due to local perturbation will be washed out because of the pre-smoothing procedure, see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, row 2, 4 and 6. Although our representation is based on the relative transformation matrices between neighbouring points, it is not as severely sensitive as curvature is, for example, to local perturbations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, the proposed metric is a left translation invariant metric. Thus, the distance between two shapes remains the same even under a deformation acting on both shapes. For instance, if G 1 ∈ SE(n) k is a deformation acting on shape S A and S B then, d(</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Ĝ A ,Ĝ B ) = d(G 1 ·Ĝ A , G 1 ·Ĝ B ).</formula><p>This fact can be observed by plugging the action of G 1 into <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> in which case it will cancel itself out. This property is particularly important in transporting deformation between two similar shapes.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, deformation transportation was framed as follows: Let S 1 and S ′ 1 be shape contours representing exactly the same real world object O 1 , only S ′ 1 is deformed under external force, e.g., different viewing angle. And let O 2 be a similar object to O 1 , but not identical, with S 2 as its shape contour. Transporting deformation is then framed as estimating how S 2 will deform, under the same external force, to give S ′ 2 . In our framework, the deformation due to the external force can be factored out as </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">G 1 · f (S 1 ) = f (S ′ 1 ), where f (·) is as defined in (2). Consequently, G 1 = f (S ′ 1 ) · f (S 1 ) −1 . Since our metric is left translation invari- ant, d(f (S 1 ), f (S 2 )) = d(G 1 · f (S 1 ), G 1 · f (S 2 )). Thus, S ′ 2 = G 1 · f (S 2 ), see</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Point correspondence</head><p>As pointed out earlier, the distance function given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> is dependent on parametrization; it assumes point correspondence between two curved shapes. In this subsection, we will present a distance function that is invariant to reparametrization; we estimate corresponding points between two given shapes.</p><p>Given two closed curves S A and S B represented by k points, the estimation of point correspondence is formulated as estimating the starting point and ordering direction of the points in S B such that (16) is minimized. In that regard, let ξ i be a k-cyclic permutation; i.e. ξ i : S B ∋ p j → p (i+j)mod k ∈ S B , where mod represents the modulo operation. Then, by construction f • ξ i = ξ i • f , where f is as defined in <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> and • is used to denote function composition. Subsequently, for a fixed ordering direction the optimal staring point of a closed curve is given by the starting point of ξ i (S B ) such that ξ i (S B ) is the ordering that minimizes the following objective function</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">I(f (S A ), f (S B )) = min i∈[1,k] d(f (S A ), ξ i (f (S B )). (17)</formula><p>To work with ordering direction, we introduce a notation for a representation of a given shape ordered in clockwise direction and representation of the same shape ordered in anti-clockwise as f ( − → S ) and f ( ← − S ), respectively. Moreover, we note that if f ( − → S ) = (ĝ 1 , · · · ,ĝ k ) then f ( ← − S ) = (ĝ −1 k , · · · ,ĝ −1 1 ). In light of the direction notation, the optimal starting point and ordering direction of S B with respect to S A is given by the solution of the following <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>: The first and the second columns show the input shapes for correspondence point estimation. The third column shows the estimated corresponding points with our methods and the last column are results estimated with Shape Context <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For visual clarity, we have scaled the results.</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">min(I(f (S A ), f ( − → S B )), I(f (S A ), f ( ← − S B ))).<label>(18)</label></formula><p>In effect, equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(18)</ref> is presented as the distance between two closed curves S A and S B where point correspondence is not known a priori. Evidently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> can also be used for finding correspondence between two closed curves, see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. The corresponding points between two open curve can be computed by dropping the k-cyclic permutation and optimizing the ordering direction alone. The solution of (18) is estimated with a brute-force approach using a nested loop iteration. Thus, the time-complexity for closed curves is O(k 2 ). More concretely, on Intel core i7-3540M with 3.0 GHz×4 processing speed and 7.7 GB RAM running Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, MATLAB implementation of the proposed metric, given in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(16)</ref>, took 0.0868 seconds, and the whole distance computation set-up, including pointcorrespondence estimation and shape representation, took 11.0509 seconds for shapes approximated by k = 100 points.</p><p>In summary, the proposed point-correspondence estimation technique assumes the sampling of points with equal arclength spacing. In such cases, the approach performs with a reasonable accuracy. On the contrary, for cases where a significant warping is required due to high variation in curvature, for example, accuracy degrades. Furthermore, the proposed approach does not consider occlusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiments</head><p>In this section we report experimental results of the proposed similarity metric on plant leaf classification problem. Furthermore, experimental results on the robustness of the metric to local shape perturbations is provided.  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Precision-recall curve of our metric on the Flavia dataset. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the precision-recall curve of several approaches is presented.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Plant leaf classification</head><p>Plant leaves are traditionally classified by experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, the magnitude of the data that is being collected is growing exponentially, rendering manual labeling inefficient. To address this problem, several feature based and shape analysis methods were proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Although, color and texture are valuable features, shape is the most discriminative, as it is rarely affected by season and environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Consequently, we evaluate our shape based similarity metric on Flavia dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The dataset contains 32 types of leaf species with a total of 1907 examples, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, a leave-one-out test scenario was performed on Flavia dataset to evaluate the elastic similarity metric, derived from SRV-framework, and to compare with other approaches. Leave-one-out is a setup where every leaf is used as a query against the rest of the database. To compare our approach with other methods, we replicate the leave-one-out scenario with Mean Average Precision (MAP) used as a performance measure. For this experiment, every leaf shape is represented by k = 200 points that are uniformly sampled from the boundary of the shape. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarizes the result of our approach and results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Although our method achieved a high MAP it is not necessarily inclusive of all the Methods MAP Angle function <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> 45.87 Shape context <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> 47.00 TSLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> 69.93 Elastic metric with 200 points <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> 81.86 Gaussian elastic metric with 200 points <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> 92.37</p><p>Our method with 200 points 94.11 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Mean average precision on the Flavia dataset.

Nonetheless, it outperformed elastic shape metric and Gaussian elastic metric, discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, in terms of MAP. One possible reason for this is that we do not presmooth the data and thus local details are more likely to be captured with our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Local shape perturbations</head><p>To demonstrate the impact of local perturbation on our metric, we test the proposed method on fighter jets dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The dataset contains 7 types of fighter jets each with 30 examples, see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Variation between the same type of planes is introduced by deforming parts of the plane and by the action of rotation matrices. We will begin our experiment by perturbing the shapes of the fighter jets with a noise sampled from a zero mean Gaussian distribution with different values for the standard deviation σ. For all subsequent experiments, the contour of every shape is approximated by uniformly sampled k = 200 points. Next, we repeat the leave-one-out test scenario where the unperturbed/original dataset is queried by every shape from the original dataset and from the datasets corrupted by a noise sampled from different Gaussian distributions. Table 2 summarizes the computed MAP values and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows their respective precision-recall curve. In general, we note that the proposed metric is not invariant to shape altering local perturbations, in terms of noise magnitude, it is however relatively robust to perturbations that do not alter the shape significantly, see <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a similarity metric for closed and open curves that can be computed in a closed form solution. The <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>: The first row shows the 7 types of fighter jets from <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The second row shows shapes with additive Gaussian noise with standard deviation of 2.5.   key point in our metric definition is the representation of how a given curve bends and stretches with rigid transformation matrices. Subsequently, a dot product defined on the product Lie algebra is used to compute the distance between two given shapes. Following the distance metric, point correspondence estimation is given by fixing one shape and optimally ordering points of another in such a way that distance between the shapes is minimized. The proposed metric is reasonably robust to small local shape perturbations unlike metrics based on differential quantities. There are several ways one can extend the proposed metric. First, it can be used for image retrieval systems in conjugation with other features like color and texture. Second, the dot product defined in (12) assigns the same weighing constants for the rotation (bending) and translation (stretching) quantities of the curve. This is not a necessary condition; a problem specific similarity metric that emphasizes one over the other can be defined by weighing the two terms in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(14)</ref> differently. Lastly, in scenarios where a labeled training dataset is available, a label specific similarity metric can be defined by taking the covariance matrix of the label's dataset as a metric tensor to define the dot product in the Lie algebra; in (12) the metric tensor is identity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Optimal transformation</head><p>The optimal rotation matrix between two vectors p 1 , p 2 ∈ R 2 can be computed by minimizing </p><p>The solution of (19) is given as R = V U T such that the covariance of the points is C = p T 1 p 2 = U ΣV T . However, the solution might include reflection and needs to be rectified, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Nevertheless, rotation in 2-dimensional space is about a point and similar with coordinate re-orientation. In high dimensional space this is not the case. As a result, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> does not necessarily give a high-dimensional rotation matrix that preserves the coordinate orientation. Meanwhile, the proposed representation computes the rotations to capture the bending of a curve relative to a fixed frame. Hence, orientation preserving rotation matrix is computed by first estimating an orthonormal basis B of the space from p 1 and p 2 with SVD. Next, the rotation plane is identified as the plane on which p 1 and p 2 lie. Subsequently, R is computed by minimizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and expressed in homogeneous coordinates. Finally, the rotation matrix that preserves coordinate orientation is given by R = BRB T .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Examples of closed curved shapes with 100 uniformly sampled points</figDesc></figure>
