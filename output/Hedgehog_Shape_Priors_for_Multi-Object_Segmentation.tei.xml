<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Star-convexity prior is popular for interactive single object segmentation due to its simplicity and amenability to binary graph cut optimization. We propose a more general multi-object segmentation approach. Moreover, each object can be constrained by a more descriptive shape prior, "hedgehog". Each hedgehog shape has its surface normals locally constrained by an arbitrary given vector field, e.g. gradient of the user-scribble distance transform. In contrast to star-convexity, the tightness of our normal constraint can be changed giving better control over allowed shapes. For example, looser constraints, i.e. wider cones of allowed normals, give more relaxed hedgehog shapes. On the other hand, the tightest constraint enforces skeleton consistency with the scribbles. In general, hedgehog shapes are more descriptive than a star, which is only a special case corresponding to a radial vector field and weakest tightness. Our approach has significantly more applications than standard single star-convex segmentation, e.g. in medical data we can separate multiple non-star organs with similar appearances and weak edges. Optimization is done by our modified α-expansion moves shown to be submodular for multi-hedgehog shapes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Distinct intensity appearances and smooth contrastaligned boundaries are standard segmentation cues. However, in most real applications of image segmentation there are multiple objects of interest with similar or overlapping color appearances. Intensity edges also could be cluttered or weak. These common practical problems require additional regularization, see the second row in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1</ref>.</p><p>Our paper proposes a simple and sufficiently general shape regularization constraint that could be easily integrated into standard MRF methods for segmentation. Shape two examples of images with seeds (medical and photo) multi-object segmentation using Potts model multi-object segmentation adding our hedgehog shapes prior priors have been successfully used in binary graph cut segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. While our "hedgehog" shape prior extends popular star-convexity constraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> in ways different from previous related methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and it has its own merits, our main contribution is a multi-hedgehog prior in the context of multi-object segmentation problems. We observe that similarity between object appearances and edge clutter are particularly problematic in larger multilabel segmentation problems, e.g. in medical imaging. Pre-vious graph cut methods did not address shape regularization constraints in such problems. Our multi-hedgehog prior is fairly flexible, has efficient optimizers, and shows significant potential in resolving very common ambiguities in multi-label segmentation problems, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(last row).</head><p>Our general multi-object segmentation framework allows to enforce "hedgehog" shape prior for any of the objects. The class of all possible hedgehog priors is sufficiently representative yet each specific hedgehog constraint offers sufficiently powerful regularization to address color overlaps and weak edges. One extreme case of our prior is related to the standard star shape prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The other extreme case allows shapes with restricted skeletons <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>The main contribution of our method is that it offers a practical and efficient way to integrate multiple shape priors into popular multi-label MRF segmentation framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Our work also allows to extend previous multisurface graph cut methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> compute multiple nested segments using one fixed polar grid defined by some non-overlapping rays. Besides particular image discretization, these rays introduce two constraints: one star-like shape constraint shared by the nested segments and a smoothness constraint penalizing segment boundary jumping between adjacent rays. In contrast, our method defines independent shape constraints for each segment. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, shape normals are constrained by arbitrary vector fields, rather than non-overlapping rays <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Our use of Cartesian grid allows to enforce standard boundary length smoothness <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. While this paper is focused on Potts model with distinct shape constraints, hedgehog shapes can be easily combined with inter-segment inclusion or exclusion constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The use of distinct (not necessarily nested) shape priors extends <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for a more detailed discussion.</p><p>There are other earlier methods for segmenting multiple objects with shape priors, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> in the context of convex optimization and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> in MRF-frameworks. These approaches require training data sets, which could be limiting when objects of interest have complex shapes that do not conform to any predefined structure, e.g. lesions. It is hard to train for such shapes. In contrast, our shape prior does not require training data and it is fairly flexible: even complex shapes could be defined via simple user interaction. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is not suitable for 3D medical segmentation where there no occlusion, since <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> allows a pixel or voxel to be assigned to multiple objects by construction.</p><p>Overview of contributions: We propose a new multilabel segmentation model and the corresponding optimization algorithm. Our contributions are summarized below.</p><p>• hedgehog shape constraint -a new flexible method for segmentation regularization based on simple and intuitive user interactions. • new multi-object segmentation energy with multi-hedgehog shape priors.</p><p>• we provide an extension of α-expansion moves <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for the proposed energy. • experimental evaluation showing how our multi-object segmentation method solves problematic cases for the standard Potts model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines our hedgehog shape prior for a simpler case of binary segmentation of one object. We discuss its properties and show how it can be globally optimized with s/t graph cuts. Section 3 defines multi-hedgehog shape constraint in the context of multi-label MRF segmentation and proposes an extension of α-expansion optimization algorithm. Our experiments in Section 4 includes multi-object segmentation of real photos and 3D multi-modal medical data. Finally, we discuss possible extensions and variations of the hedgehog prior in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Hedgehog shape constraint for one object</head><p>This section describes hedgehog shape prior for a single object in case of binary segmentation. Section 3 describes a more general multi-hedgehog segmentation prior where multiple objects can have separate hedgehog constraints. While multi-hedgehog prior helps in a much wider range of problems, e.g. in medical imaging, binary segmentation with one "hedgehog" is easier to start from and it has merits on its own. In particular, single-hedgehog prior generalizes popular star-convexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> in binary segmentation.</p><p>Similarly to star prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, hedgehog prior could be defined interactively. Instead of a single click in the star center, hedgehog shape allows an arbitrary scribble roughly corresponding to its skeleton. Hedgehog can also be defined by an approximate user-defined outline of a desired shape or by a shape template. In any case, such scribble, outline, or template define the corresponding (signed) distance transform or distance map d : Ω → R and a field of its gradients ∇d, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.2</ref>. Section 5 explores the potential/merits of using other vector fields. Our hedgehog constraint for segment S is defined by vector field {∇d p | p ∈ Ω} and angular threshold θ restricting orientations of surface normalsn S p at any point p on the boundary of S to a cone</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C θ (p) : ∠(n S p , ∇d p ) ≤ θ ∀p ∈ ∂S<label>(1)</label></formula><p>assuming gradient ∇d p is defined at p. More generally, hedgehog constraint for segment S could be defined by any given vector field {v p | p ∈ Ω} defining preferred directions for surface normals, Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we can use dot product to define allowed normals cones C θ (p) : ⟨n S p ,v p ⟩ ≥ τ where width varies depending on the magnitude ofv p . In casev p = ∇d p this constraint reduces to (1) for τ = cos(θ) since |∇d p | = 1 at all points where gradient ∇d p exists. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(a) scribble's distance map d (b) constraint ∠(n S p , ∇d p ) ≤ θ</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Single hedgehog properties</head><p>Even a single hedgehog shape prior discussed in this section could be useful in practice. For example, if θ = π/2 it closely approximates a popular star convexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> in case of a single click. However, our formulation uses locally defined constraints, which can be approximated by a simple rule for selecting local edges, see Section 2.2. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, we do not enforce a global tree/forest structure, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.3</ref>(b). Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, hedgehog prior allows a much larger variability of shapes for scribbles different from a point. In our case, a scribble defines a rough skeleton of a shape. For smaller values of θ our cone constraints (1) give a tighter alignment of surface normals with vectors ∇d p forcing the segment boundary to follow the levelsets of the scribble's distance map d. Under certain conditions 1 this implies consistency of segment's skeleton with the skeleton of the given scribble, outline, or template.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Single hedgehog via graph cuts</head><p>We show an approximation for hedgehog constraint (1) for object S in the context of binary N-dimensional image segmentation via graph cuts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. All cone constraints (1) for any given θ and distance map gradients ∇d, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.3</ref>(a), correspond to a certain set of infinity cost directed edges, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.3</ref>(b). For example, consider cone of allowed surface normals C θ (p) at some point p illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.4</ref> for two different values of parameter θ. It is easy to see that a surface/boundary of segment S passing at p has normal n S p ∈ C θ (p) iff this surface does not cross the corresponding polar conê</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C θ (p) := {(py) | ⟨(py), (pz)⟩ ≤ 0 ∀z ∈ C θ (p)}.

(3)</formula><p>Obviously, hedgehog constraints are better approximated by large neighbour systems N . The reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for a more detailed discussion and experiments regarding discretization artifacts and how to avoid them. It is easy to see that set (3) of infinity cost edges corresponds to a submodular pairwise energy approximating hedgehog shape constraint (1) for binary labeling</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f = {f p } representing segment S = {p | f p = 1} h θ (f ) = ∑ (pq)∈E(θ) w ∞ · [f p = 1, f q = 0]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where w ∞ is an infinitely large scalar.  <ref type="formula">)</ref> and (c). The hedgehog prior reduces to star-shape prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> only in (b) when θ = 90 and if the star center was the octagon's center. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> shows a simple foreground/background segmentation experiment illustrating how the choice of θ and vector field affects the segmentation result. As you case see in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.5(b)</ref> increasing θ leads to a segmentation that better aligns with the levelsets of the distance transform which is beneficial in case of clutter. Also, using a different vector field other than the gradient of the distance transform leads to a different set of allowed shapes by the hedgehog prior. We can see how the choice the vector field affected the segmentation by comparing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.5(b)</ref> to (c) for the same θ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Multi-hedgehog segmentation energy</head><p>Given a set of pixels P, neighborhood system N , and labels L our multi-labeling segmentation energy is</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E(f ) = data ∑ p∈P D p (f p ) + smoothness λ ∑ pq∈N V pq (f p , f q ) + hedgehogs H θ (f ) (5) where f = {f p ∈ L| ∀p ∈ P} is a labeling.</formula><p>The first two terms, namely data and smoothness terms, are widely used in computer vision, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. The data term commonly referred to as the regional term as it measures how well pixels fit into their corresponding labels. To be specific, D p (f p ) is the penalty for assigning label f p to pixel p. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a label's probabilistic model, Gaussian Mixture in our case, is found by fitting a probabilistic model to the seeds given by the user.</p><p>The smoothness term is a standard pairwise regularizer that discourages segmentation discontinuities between neighboring pixels. A discontinuity occurs whenever two neighboring pixels pq ∈ N are assigned to different labels. In its simplest form,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">V pq (f p , f q ) = w pq [f p ̸ = f q ] where [ ]</formula><p>is Iverson bracket and w pq is a non-increasing function of the intensities at p and q. Also, λ is a parameter that weights the importance of the smoothness term.</p><p>Third term, our contribution, is the Hedgehog term</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">H θ (f ) = ∑ k∈L ∑ (pq)∈E k (θ) w ∞ [f p = k, f q ̸ = k]<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where w ∞ = ∞. Those familiar with graph cuts may prefer to think of it as an ∞-cost arc from p to q, thus prohibiting any cut that statisfy f p = k and f q ̸ = k. The Hedgehog term is the sum of the Hedgehog constraints over all the labels and it guarantees that any feasible labeling 2 , i.e. E(f ) &lt; ∞, will result in a segmentation with surface normals respecting the orientation constraints (1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Expansion Moves</head><p>In this section we will describe how to extend the binary expansion moves of α-exp <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> to respect the shape constraints, and show that these moves are submodular. The main idea of α-exp algorithm is to maintain a current feasible labeling f ′ , i.e. E(f ′ ) &lt; ∞, and iteratively move to a better labeling until no improvements could be made. To be specific at each iteration, a label α ∈ L is chosen and variables f p for all p ∈ P are given a binary choice x p ; 0 to retain their old label f p = f ′ p or 1 switch to α, i.e. f p = α.</p><p>The Hedgehog term (6) for a binary α-exp move could be written as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">H α θ (x) = ∑ (p,q)∈Eα(θ) S pq (x p , x q ) + ∑ k∈L\α ∑ f ′ p =f ′ q =k (pq)∈E k (θ) S qp (x q , x p ) (7) where x = {x p ∈ {0, 1} | ∀p ∈ P} and S pq (x p , x q ) = { ∞ if x p = 1, x q = 0 0 otherwise.<label>(8)</label></formula><p>The first term in <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> guarantees that the resulting labeling respects label α hedgehog constraints. In addition, the second term guarantees that the hedgehog constraints satisfied by the current labeling f ′ for all labels in L \ α are not violated by the new labeling f .</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, any first-order binary function could be exactly optimized if all pairwise terms are submodular. A binary function g of two variables is submodular if g(0, 0) + g(1, 1) ≤ g(1, 0) + g(0, 1). Our energy <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> is submodular as it could be written as the sum of submodular pairwise binary energies over all possible pairs of p and q. Notice that for any given pq pair, S pq (1, 1) = 0 by construction and S pq (0, 0) = 0 as long as the current labeling is a feasible one, i.e. it does not cut any of the ∞-cost arcs. Also, S pq (1, 0) and S pq (0, 1) are both ≥ 0 by construction. Therefore, the submodularity condition is satisfied for all pairs of p and q. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.6</ref> shows an illustrative example of an α-exp move over the green label. In this example we assume that we are enforcing the shape constraints only for the green and purple labels. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.6(a)</ref> shows the initial seeds for three different labels while (b) shows the current feasible labeling. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.6</ref>(c-d) show the shape constraints enforced by green and purple labels while expanding the green label. Note, green shape constraints are enforced all over the image while purple shape constraints are enforced inside its current labeling support area, as it is not necessarily to enforce it everywhere. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.6</ref>(e) shows a feasible move that respects green and purple shape constraints while (f) shows an infeasible move that respects only the green shape constraints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>In the following set of experiments we show the benefit of incorporating our Hedgehogs term <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> to the well studied Potts model segmentation energy, i.e. data term + smoothness term, for multi-object segmentation in 2D and 3D. We will also give an illustrative real life example to show that the hedgehog shape is more general than star-shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The results shown in this section for our method were generated using θ = π 4 when computing the hedgehog shape constraints, also we did not enforce any shape constraints on the background model. Also, the same smoothness weight λ is used when comparing methods unless stated otherwise. Our optimization framework is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> where the user marks a set of initial seeds in the form of a scribble for the required labels, e.g. left kidney, right kidney etc. The seeds for each label were used to fit an initial Gaussian Mixture color model, and to generate its hedgehog shape constraints. Similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, we iteratively optimize our energy (5) (or Potts model) in an EM-style iterative fashion.</p><p>We alternate between finding a better segmentation and reestimating the color models using the current segmentation. Finally, the framework terminates when it can not decrease the energy anymore. For the example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.7(a), (b-c)</ref> show Potts model results for λ = 2 and 6, respectively. It should be noted that 6 is the smallest smoothness weight that did not result in oversegmentation when using Potts. However, the result in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.7</ref>(c) is biased towards smaller objects (notice star tips) because by increasing the smoothness we are also increasing the shrinking bias. Oversegmented results as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.7</ref>(b) could be avoided without increasing the shrinking bias by incorporating multi-shape priors. Our method which incorporates Hedgehog priors with Potts model was able to find a better segmentation, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.7(d)</ref>.</p><p>The objective of the example shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.8(a)</ref> is to segment left and right lungs, and the background. Potts model result shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.8(b)</ref> has holes, i.e. part of the background appears in the middle of the lungs. Furthermore, Potts model converged to biased color models where the right lung preferred brighter colors while the left preferred darker colors. Similar to the previous example, increasing λ for Potts model will increase the shrinking bias and it becomes hard to segment the elongated part of the the right lung. Using multi-star which is a generalization of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to multi-object segmentation is not enough because the right lung is not a star-shape. To be specific, there is no point . Two hedgehogs one for each lung. As can be seen in (b) Potts model resulted in segmentation with holes (background inside lungs), and converged to wrong color models. Segmentation holes could be eliminated by using multi-star shape priors (c)-star centers are the midpoints of the green and red circles. However, multi-star can never properly segment the right lung as it is not a star-shape. Our method (Hedgehogs + Potts) (d) eliminated holes and properly segmented the lungs by enforcing a more general shape constraint derived from the user scribble.</p><p>inside the right lung that could act as a center of a starshape that would include it. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.8(d)</ref> shows the result for our method, where user scribbles were used to enforce shape constraints compared to using a single pixel per label <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We applied our method on PET-CT scans of three different subjects to segment their liver, left kidney, right kidney and the background. Although we applied our method and Potts model on the 3D volumes we only show the results on a few representative slices from each volume in <ref type="figure">Fig.9</ref>. Also, the results of different methods for each subject were computed using the same smoothness. We can see from the last two rows which compare our method to Potts, using Hedgehogs constraints enabled us to avoid geometrically incorrect segmentations, e.g. one liver inside the other (last-row middle), or parts of left kidney is between the right kidney and liver (last-row right). Furthermore, for test subjects 1 and 2 the kidneys and background were poorly segmented by Potts model, e.g. most of the kidneys were segmented as background for test subject 1. Potts poor performance is due to the large overlap between the kidneys and background color models. This overlap resulted in an in-discriminative data term for Potts to properly separate them. This issue becomes worse in iterative frameworks where color models are re-estimated based on current segmentation. To be specific, if at any iteration Potts model resulted in a bad segmentation then re-estimating the color models will bias them towards the bad segmentation and subsequent iterations worsen the results. Comparing our results for subjects 1 and 2 to Potts model shows that our method is less prone Subject 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Subject 2 Subject 3                                                                                                                                       </formula><p>Our method (Hedgehogs Shapes + Potts)</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">                                                                   Same Slice</formula><p>Potts <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>As illustrated in Section 2.2 the vector field plays an important role in controlling the set of shapes allowed by the hedgehog prior. While this work focuses only on a very basic vector field, i.e. gradient of the distance transform, the obtained results are promising. There are many ways to extend our work in regards of which vector field to use, which constraints to enforce and how to enforce them.</p><p>Instead of Euclidean distance transform gradients, hedgehog prior vector field can correspond to the gradient of the geodesic distance transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> incorporating information about image colors. In case of binary segmentation with θ = π 2 and with such geodesic vector field the hedgehog shape prior is similar to the geodesic-star <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Another idea for a hedgehog vector field could be based on a shape template and its medial axis transform with a known radius function. One can generate a set of nested shapes by scaling the radius function and compute the hedgehog vector field as the normals to these shapes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>. This figure shows a few different shape penalty/cost functions vs. γ, i.e. the angle between a segment's normal and its preferred orientation, but any convex function could be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In this work we only experimented with f1.</p><p>Our proposed hedgehog utilizes only the angular information of the vector field. Alternatively, one could replace the hard constraints, i.e. ∞-cost edges, with soft constraints proportional to the vector field's magnitude at each pixel. In general, hedgehog prior could utilize different shape penalty functions as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.10</ref>. In this work we only explored f 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.10</ref>, for simplicity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a novel interactive multi-object segmentation method where objects are independently restricted by hedgehog shape priors. In a nutshell, hedgehog shape prior for a given object uses a vector field derived from the user interaction to restrict the object's surface normals. In addition, we showed how to modify α-expansion moves to optimize our multi-labeling problem with hedgehog constraints. We also proved submodularity of the modified binary expansion moves. Furthermore, we applied our multilabeling segmentation with hedgehog shapes on 2D images and 3D medical volumes. Our experiments show the significant improvement in segmentation accuracy when using our method over Potts model. Specially in medical data where our method outperformed Potts model in separating multiple organs with similar appearances and weak edges.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Hedgehog shapes prior for multi-object segmentation.</figDesc></figure>
