<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Given a set of data X = {x i , y i } N i=1 , a frequently occurring problem in computer vision is to remove the outliers in X . Often this is achieved by fitting a model, parametrized by θ ∈ R L , that has the largest consensus set I within X maximize θ,I⊆X |I| subject to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x T i θ − y i ≤ ǫ ∀{x i , y i } ∈ I,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where ǫ ≥ 0 is the inlier threshold. The solution I * is the maximum consensus set, with consensus size |I * |. In this paper, we call I * as true inliers, and X \ I * as true outliers, to indicate this segmentation as our target result. Randomized algorithms such as RANSAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref> and its variants are often used for outlier removal by approximately solving (1). Specifically, via a hypothesize-and-test procedure, RANSAC finds an approximate solutionĨ to (1), where |Ĩ| ≤ |I * |, and the subset X \Ĩ are removed as outliers. Usually RANSAC-type algorithms do not provide optimality bounds, i.e.,Ĩ can differ arbitrarily from I * . Also, in generalĨ ⊆ I * , hence, the consensus setĨ of RANSAC may contain true outliers, or conversely some of the data removed by RANSAC may be true inliers.</p><p>Solving (1) exactly, however, is non-trivial. Maximum consensus is an instance of the maximum feasible subsystem (MaxFS) problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chap. 7]</ref>, which is intractable in general. Exact algorithms for (1) are brute force search in nature, whose runtime increases rapidly with N . The most well known is branch-and-bound (BnB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">27]</ref>, which can take exponential time in the worst case. For a fixed dimension L of θ, the problem can be solved in time proportional to an L-th order polynomial of N <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">6]</ref>. However, this is only practical for small L.</p><p>In this paper, we present a guaranteed outlier removal (GORE) approach to speed up exact solutions of maximum consensus. Rather than attempting to solve (1) directly, our technique reduces X to a subset X ′ , under the condition</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I * ⊆ X ′ ⊆ X ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>i.e., any data removed by our reduction of X are guaranteed to be true outliers. While X ′ may not be outlier-free, solving (1) exactly on X ′ will take less time, while yielding the same result as on the original input X ; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>. Note that naive heuristics used to reduce X , e.g., by removing the most outlying data according to RANSAC, will not guarantee (2) and preserve global optimality. Instead, we propose a mixed integer linear program (MILP) algorithm to conduct GORE. For clarity our initial derivations will be based on the linear regression residual |x T θ − y|. In Sec. 3, we will extend our algorithm to handle geometric (non-linear regression) residuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>.</p><p>We can expect that solving (1) on X ′ instead of X will be much faster, since any exact algorithm scales badly with problem size, and thus can be speeded up by even small reductions of X . Of course, the time spent on conducting GORE must be included in the overall runtime. Intuitively, the effort required to remove all true outliers is unlikely to be less than that for solving (1) on X without any data re-  Removing 5 true outliers (points circled in red) using the proposed GORE algorithm (50s) and subjecting the remaining data X ′ to Gurobi returns the same maximum consensus set in 32.5s. This represents a reduction of 80% in the total runtime. Note that while removing such bad outliers using RANSAC may be easy, it does not guarantee that only true outliers are removed; indeed it may also remove true inliers.</p><p>moved. An immediate question is thus how many true outliers must be removed for the proposed reduction scheme to pay off? We will show that removing a small percentage of the most egregious true outliers using GORE is relatively cheap, and doing this is sufficient to speed up (1) substantially. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>, reducing X by a mere 5% using GORE decreases the total runtime required to find the globally optimal result by 80%. In Sec. 4, we will show similar performance gains on practical computer vision problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Related work</head><p>A priori removing some of the outliers in a highly contaminated dataset to speed up a subsequent exact algorithm is not a new idea. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>, the proposed BnB algorithm was suggested as a means for "post validating" the result of RANSAC. However, culling the data with a fast approximate algorithm somewhat defeats the purpose of finding an exact solution afterwards, since the obtained result is not guaranteed to be optimal w.r.t. the original input. In contrast, our approach does not suffer from this weakness, since GORE removes only true outliers.</p><p>Our work is an extension of two recent techniques for GORE <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">5]</ref>, respectively specialized for estimating 2D rigid transforms and 3D rotations (both are 3DOF problems). In both works, the authors exploit the underlying geometry of the target model to quickly prune keypoint matches that do not lie in the maximum consensus settheir methods, therefore, cannot be applied to models other than 2D rigid transform and 3D rotation. In contrast, our algorithm is substantially more flexible; first, the linear regression model we use in (1) is applicable to a larger range of problems. Second, as we will show in Sec. 3, our formulation can be easily extended to geometric (non-linear regression) residuals used in computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Underpinning the flexibility of our method is a MILP formulation, which "abstracts away" the calculation of bounds required for GORE. Further, our MILP formulation allows the utilization of efficient commercial off-the-shelf solvers (e.g., CPLEX, Gurobi) to handle up to 6DOF models.</p><p>Beyond RANSAC and its variants, there exist other approximate methods for outlier removal. The l ∞ approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">26]</ref> recursively finds the l ∞ estimate and removes the data with the largest residual, until a consensus set is obtained. While this guarantees that at least one true outlier will be removed in each step, the resulting consensus set may be smaller than the optimal consensus size since true inliers may also be removed. The l 1 approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref> seeks an estimate that minimizes the sum of the residuals that exceed ǫ. After arriving at a solution, data whose residual exceeds ǫ are removed as outliers. Again, there is no guarantee that only true outliers will be removed, and the resulting consensus set may not be the largest it can be.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MILP formulation for GORE</head><p>Problem (1) can be restated as removing as few data as possible to reach a consistent subset.

Our main GORE algorithm, to be described in Sec. 2.2, prioritizes the test for data with the largest errors with respect to the suboptimal parameterθ, i.e., those withẑ i = 1.</p></div>

In particular, we compared the runtime of exactly solving (1) on the input data X (we call this EXACT), with the total runtime of running GORE to reduce X to X ′ and exactly solving (1) on X ′ (we call this GORE+EXACT). To solve (1) exactly, we apply the industry-grade Gurobi Optimizer to exactly solve the MILP formulation (3). Of course, as mentioned in Sec. 2, GORE itself is implemented using Gurobi; this combination thus enabled a cogent test of the benefit of GORE.</p><p>We emphasize that GORE is a preprocessing routine that is independent of any exact algorithm for maximum consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">6]</ref> -therefore, these algorithms should not be seen as "competitors" of our work. While we expect preprocessing by GORE to also significantly speed-up these algorithms, the lack of mature implementations hamper accurate evaluations. More relevant competitors are <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">5]</ref>. However, these methods are specialized for 2D rigid transform and 3D rotations, where the associated maximum consensus problems do not have MILP formulations, thus direct comparisons with GORE are infeasible.</p><p>To evaluate the practicality of GORE+EXACT, we compared against the following approximate methods:</p><p>• RANSAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>; • l ∞ outlier removal <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>; and • l 1 outlier removal <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Our method was applied on several common problems in computer vision. The experiments were carried out on a standard 2.70 GHz machine with 128 GB of RAM. A value of M = 1000 was used in all the MILP instances for solving computer vision problems, and a value of M = 10000 was used to solve synthetic data. A demo program (requiring Matlab and Gurobi) is given in the supplementary material.</p><p>Note that GORE (Algorithm 1) requires an approximate solution to obtain the upper boundû. In our experiments, we used RANSAC, but any approximate method is applicable. Note also that the runtime of the approximate method was included in the runtime of GORE in our results below. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(17)</ref> was produced to test GORE. For simplicity, in this experiment we used c i = 0 and d i = 1 for all i. The ground truth θ ∈ R L was generated uniformly in [−1, 1] L . Each A i was drawn uniformly randomly from [−50, 50] 2×L , and b i was obtained as b i = −A i θ. This justifies the residual</p></div>

To simulate outliers, 55% of the "dependent measurements" {b i } N i=1 were perturbed Combinations of (L, N ) tested were (3, 140), (4, 120), (5, 100), (6, 80), <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">70)</ref>, and (8, 50). We reduced N for higher L to avoid excessively long runtimes -this does not invalidate our assessment of GORE since we are primarily interested in the speed-up ratio. For each (L, N ) pair, we created 20 data instances X . On each X , we executed EX-ACT and GORE+EXACT with ǫ = 2. For GORE, the number of rejection tests T was varied from 1 to ⌈0.15N ⌉, while the maximum duration per test c was fixed to 15s.</p><p>The computational gain achieved by GORE on input data X can be expressed as the ratio</p><formula xml:id="formula_36">1 − runtime of GORE+EXACT runtime of EXACT .<label>(25)</label></formula><p>The median gain across for varying T (expressed as a ratio of N ) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>. The gain is negative for L = 3, since EXACT was very fast on such a low dimension and running GORE simply inflated the runtime (although in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref> a large positive gain was obtained for a problem with L = 3, the type of data and residual function used were different). For L = 4 to 7, the gain increases with T , implying that as more true outliers were removed, the runtime of EXACT was reduced quickly. After T ≈ 0.1N , the gain increases very slowly. For L = 8, however, the gain is negative; this was because GORE was unable to reject sufficient true outliers within the limit of c = 15s for the preprocessing to pay off. The result suggests that there exist a lower and upper limit on L for GORE to be useful.</p></div>

As expected, although the approximate methods were fast, they did not return the globally optimal result. GORE was able to reduce X by 5 to 10 true outliers with the given runtime. However, this was sufficient to significantly reduce the runtime of solving (1) such that GORE+EXACT was much faster than EXACT on all of the data instances (respectively 78%, 79%, 57%, 35% and 63% gain).</p></div>

Also, unlike in affine image matching, GORE was less prolific in removing true outliers; on average it was able to remove just 2 true outliers out of T = 10 attempts. Interestingly, however, we can see rejecting just 2 true outliers was able to speed-up significantly the overall runtime of GORE+EXACT (at least for 3 of the image pairs).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We propose GORE as a way to speed up the exact solution of the maximum consensus problem. GORE preprocesses the data to identify and remove instances guaranteed to be outliers to the globally optimal solution. The proposed method works by inspecting data instances that are most likely outliers to the global solution, and prove using contradiction that it is a true outlier. The rejection test is based on comparing upper and lower bound values derived using MILP. We also showed how GORE can be extended to deal with geometric residuals that are quasiconvex. The fact that GORE is formulated as a MILP allows it to be easily implemented using any off-the-shelf optimization software.</p><p>GORE is experimentally evaluated on synthetically generated and real data, based on common computer vision applications. While there are limitations to GORE in terms of the range of model dimensions that it can handle, we demonstrate that it is still very useful and effective on a wide range of practical computer vision applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( a )</head><label>a</label><figDesc>|X | = 100, time to solution = 423.07s (global optimization) (b) |X ′ | = 95, time to sol. = 50s (GORE) + 32.5s (glob. opt.) = 82.5s</figDesc></figure>
