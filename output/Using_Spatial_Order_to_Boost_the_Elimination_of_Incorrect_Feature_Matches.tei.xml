<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Correctly matching feature points in a pair of images is an important preprocessing step for many computer vision applications. In this paper we propose an efficient method for estimating the number of correct matches without explicitly computing them. In addition, our method estimates the region of overlap between the images. To this end, we propose to analyze the set of matches using the spatial order of the features, as projected to the x-axis of the image. The set of features in each image is thus represented by a sequence. This reduces the analysis of the matching problem to the analysis of the permutation between the sequences. Using the Kendall distance metric between permutations and natural assumptions on the distribution of the correct and incorrect matches, we show how to estimate the abovementioned values. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method in two applications: (i) a new halting condition for RANSAC based epipolar geometry estimation methods that considerably reduce the running time, and (ii) discarding spatially unrelated image pairs in the Structure-from-Motion pipeline. Furthermore, our analysis can be used to compute the probability that a given match is correct based on the estimated number of correct matches and the rank of the features within the sequences. Our experiments on a large number of synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, the running time of the image matching stage in the Structure-from-Motion pipeline may be reduced by about 99% while preserving about 80% of the correctly matched feature points.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Matching feature points between a pair of images is a fundamental problem in computer vision. The estimation of epipolar geometry between images <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, 3D structure reconstruction (SfM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, and scene recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> are typical examples of useful tasks that are based on feature matching. While many methods for feature matching exist, the critical stage of filtering incorrect matches is costly when using algorithms such as Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we propose to analyze the set of correct matches, without explicitly computing it, using the spatial order of the features in each image. We estimate the number of correct matches and the probability that a given match is correct. In addition, we estimate the overlap region of the pair of images and whether they overlap at all. Our method can be applied to sets of matching features irrespective of their descriptors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>) or the matching method used to compute them. Our method can be used as a preprocessing step to improve the efficiency of existing methods such as RANSAC and SfM, as described below.</p><p>The basic idea is as follows. We represent the image features as sequences defined by their spatial order along the x-axis of the image. The matching between features in a pair of images induces a permutation that relates the spatial order in one image to that in the other image (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). The matching is analyzed using a measure of correlation between permutations, the Kendall distance metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. We use statistical assumptions on the distribution of correctly and incorrectly matched features; the spatial order of correctly matched features is usually preserved, while incorrectly matched features are expected to have random order. Note that the problem is not trivialized by these assumptions since simply computing the largest set of features that preserve their spatial order does not necessarily provide the correct set of matches (see discussion in Sec. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. Hence, we also consider the interaction between correct and incorrect matches for obtaining our estimations.</p><p>Our estimation of the number of correct matches can be used to improve the running time of RANSAC methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. In adaptive RANSAC, a subset of matches in a pair of images is randomly sampled and used to compute the expected geometric transformation between the features (e.g., homography or epipolar geometry), which is then verified against all matches. The transformation with the largest set of inliers, features consistent with the computed geometric transformation, is chosen. Since the number of inliers is usually unknown, the number of required itera-tions is high. This increases the running time of RANSAC, which is its major drawback. Our estimate of the number of correct matches can be used to improve the running time by halting when a consensus set of this size is obtained (see Sec. 6).</p><p>Computing the structure of the scene and the cameras' parameters from a set of images using SfM methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>) is a fundamental problem in computer vision with many applications. Such methods, which typically require tens or hundreds of images, strongly rely on correct matches. A major time consuming step in SfM methods is the robust matching of features between image pairs, which is typically obtained by RANSAC. Our method can significantly shorten the SfM pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> by running RANSAC only on image pairs with a sufficiently large number of correct matches (see Sec. 6).</p><p>We show that the number of correct matches can also be used to compute the probability that a given match is correct. One application of such probability is in improving the performance of guided RANSAC, where matches that are more likely to be correct are sampled more often (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>). In existing methods the probability that a given match is correct is based only on feature descriptors, whereas in our method it is based on the features' order in the image. Thus, our method by itself or in combination with appearance based methods give a more accurate probability for the correctness of a match than when using the method based only on feature descriptors (see details in Sec. 5).</p><p>The main contribution of the paper is a novel analysis of the correct and incorrect matches with respect to their spatial order in the images. Given a set of putative matches, our method efficiently estimates the number of correct ones, the region of overlap between a pair of images, and for each match the probability that it is correct. These estimations can be used to improve the efficiency of RANSAC and SfM methods, as demonstrated empirically in Sec. 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Feature point matching between a pair of images has been studied extensively in computer vision. Over the years many interest point detectors and patch descriptors were proposed to detect and match the images of the same 3D points in the scene (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>). Appearance based methods, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, discard descriptors by learning their success rate in matching between their corresponding features, in order to increase the proportion of correct to incorrect matches. Other methods use local geometric structures between a number of matches in order to decrease the probability of mismatching, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>A major drawback of the RANSAC method for filtering incorrect matches is its running time; for example, running RANSAC on a pair of images with 1000 matches may  take a few seconds, which can be a major bottleneck in online applications involving large sets of images. To improve RANSAC's runtime, methods for guiding the sampling of matches according to their probability to be correct (instead of a uniform sampling) were proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. For example, the similarity of feature appearance defined by Lowe's distance ratio between the closest and the second closest matches <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is used as a match correctness likelihood by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. This method ignores important geometric information. In our method, we use the spatial order of the matched features, which carries geometric information. A comparison between probabilities computed by our method and Lowe's distance ratio is provided in Sec. 6. An inlier rate estimation was also used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to compute a homography transformation between two images, which is guaranteed to find an approximation to the global optimum. The rate is computed by counting the number of homographies that agree with each inlier rate. The drawback of the method is the search process, which is time consuming and is applicable only to homographies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Problem Formulation</head><p>Let M = {(p i , q j )} be a set of putative matches between two feature sequences, p 1 , . . . , p N and q 1 , . . . , q N , in a pair of images, I 1 and I 2 , respectively. The index i of p i represents the position (the rank) of the feature in the sequence of I 1 , when sorted according to the x coordinate. Similarly, the index j of q j corresponds to the rank in the feature sequence of I 2 . For the rest of the paper, let us represent M by two sequences of indexes, [N ] = 1, . . . , N and σ, where (p i , q σ(i) ) ∈ M (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>The set of matches, M, can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, the correct ("Good") and the incorrect ("Bad") matches. Let G and B be the sets of indexes in I 1 for which the matching is correct and incorrect, respectively. In this case, the number of matches is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N = N G + N B , where N G = |G| and N B = |B|.</formula><p>We analyze the spatial orders of matched features in the pair of images, which is represented by the permutation σ. We use statistical assumptions on the distribution of the correct and incorrect matches, which allows us to estimate the number of correct matches, N G without explicitly computing the set of correct matches. In addition, we propose a method to compute the probability that a given match is correct.</p><p>To do so, we use the Kendall <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> distance that corresponds to the sum of order inversions in σ. The two main statistical assumptions used are:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A1:</head><p>The spatial order of the correctly matched features in I 1 is preserved in I 2 . This assumption holds when (i) the cameras have no relative roll (rotation around the z-axis), and (ii) there are no "poles", i.e., features with significant difference in depth on different surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A2:</head><p>The spatial order of incorrect matches is random. This can be justified since the spatial location of incorrectly matched features in different images is arbitrary.</p><p>Assumption A1 mostly holds since in natural scenes there are few inversions between correct matches. (This assumption is often used in stereo matching algorithms e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.) Moreover, the roll value is often available in the camera so it can be compensated for. We note here that, based on assumptions A1 and A2, it may seem that the set of correct matches can be obtained directly by finding the longest increasing (nonconsecutive) subsequence, L(N ). This approach yields poor results for two reasons. First, due to local order inversions between adjacent correct matches, caused by small changes in depth and camera roll, |L(N )| is usually not a good estimation for N G . Second, it is proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> that for a random permutation of size N the expectation of |L(N )| is 2 √ N ; thus, when N G is low, L(N ) may correspond to only incorrect matches or to a mixture of correct and incorrect matches. In contrast to this naïve approximation, our analysis also considers the distribution of the order of the incorrect matches and therefore better estimates N G even for low values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">The Number of Correct Matches</head><p>Two sequences are considered fully overlapped if the fields of view (FOV) of the corresponding images consist of the same region of the scene. We first consider the case of fully overlapped sequences (Sec. 4.2) and then present a method to compute the regions of overlap between the pair of images (Sec. 4.3). The Kendall distance metric that is used to estimate N G is reviewed next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The Kendall Distance</head><p>The Kendall distance is the number of pairwise order inversions in the two sequences [N ] and σ. Two pairs of matched features, (p i , q σ(i) ) and (p j , q σ(j) ), have order inversion if the orders (i, j) and (σ(i), σ(j)) are inverted. Formally, let us define a binary function, η σ :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">η σ (i, j) =          1 (i &lt; j) ∧ (σ(i) &gt; σ(j)) or (i &gt; j) ∧ (σ(i) &lt; σ(j)) 0 otherwise.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The Kendall distance is thus given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">K([N ], σ) = 1≤i≤N i&lt;j≤N η σ (i, j).<label>(2)</label></formula><p>To compute N G from the value K = K([N ], σ) we formulate K as the sum of three terms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">K = K G + K B + K GB ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where K G corresponds to the number of order inversions between correct matches, K B between incorrect matches, and K GB between pairs of correct and incorrect matches. That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">K G = i∈G j∈G i&lt;j η σ (i, j), K B = i∈B j∈B i&lt;j η σ (i, j), K GB = i∈G j∈B i&lt;j η σ (i, j).<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">For N G = N (i.e., |B| = 0) it follows directly from A1 that K = K G = 0. On the other hand it follows directly from A2 that if N G &lt; N (i.e., |B| &gt; 0), then K &gt; K B &gt; 0.</formula><p>Hence, a simple case to consider is when</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">K = 0 which implies N G = N .</formula><p>To obtain an explicit equation in N G for K &gt; 0, the terms in Eq. 3 are normalized by the maximal possible number of pairwise order inversions; that is, the number of pairs in each term. The number of pairs are given by N (N −1)/2 in a sequence of length N , and by N G N B between two disjoint sequences of lengths N G and N B . That is,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">K B = 2K B N B (N B −1) ,K G = 2K G N G (N G −1) , K = 2K N (N −1) ,K GB = K GB N G N B .<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">O 1 O 2 R 2 L 1 I 1 I 2 Figure 2.</formula><p>A partial overlap between a pair of images from the ZuBuD dataset.</p><p>Using some algebraic manipulation after substituting the terms in Eq. 3 by Eq. 5 and replacing N B = N − N G , we obtain the following quadratic equation in N G :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">0 = N 2 G [K G +K B − 2K GB ]+ N G [2NK GB − (2N − 1)K B −K G ]+ N (N − 1)(K B −K).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Note that N is given andK can be directly computed from the set of matches, M, using Eq. 2. Using assumption A1 it directly follows thatK G = 0, from assumption A2 it follows that E(K B ) = 1/2, where E(x) is the expected value of x (see our proof in supplementary material; and alternative proof <ref type="bibr">[11, p. 257]</ref>). We next show how to estimate E(K GB ) for fully overlapped and partially overlapped sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Full Overlap</head><p>For fully overlapping sequences a third statistical assumption is used:</p><p>A3: The distribution of the features that correspond to correct matches within the features that correspond to incorrect matches is uniform in [N ] and σ; that is, the expected number of features in G and B in every interval of size s is sN G /N and sN B /N , respectively.</p><p>This assumption obviously does not hold for the nonoverlapping margins which contain only incorrect matches (see Sec. 4.3 which considers this case). In the full-overlap case, the following claim holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Claim 1. Under assumptions A1-A3, E(K GB ) = 1/3.</formula><p>To prove this claim, let us first define H σ (i) to be the number of inversions in which a match, (i, σ(i)), participates. The desired value, E(K GB ), is obtained by averaging E(H σ (i)) over all i ∈ G and normalizing it by N G N B . By definition, H σ (i) is the number of features from the left of i that match features to the right of σ(i) and those from the right of i that match a features to the left of σ(i). We can use assumption A2 to compute the expected value of H σ (i) for i ∈ G given the number of indexes with incorrect matches to the left and right of i (β l 1 and β r 1 ) and to the left and right of σ(i) (β l 2 and β r 2 ). The probability of inversion between i ∈ G and j &lt; i is given by β r 2 /N B . A similar argument is used for j ∈ B and j &gt; i. Hence we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">E(H σ (i)|i ∈ G, β l 1 , β r 1 , β l 2 , β r 2 ) = β l 1 β r 2 N B + β l 2 β r 1 N B .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Using assumption A3 we can approximate σ(i) ≈ i, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">E(β l 1 ) = E(β l 2 ) = iN B /N and E(β r 1 ) = E(β r 2 ) = (N − i)N B /N ; thus E(H σ (i)) = 2 i(N − i)N B N 2 = 2N B x(1 − x), where x = i/N . The mean of x(1 − x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 is 1/6, and thus E(K GB ) = 1 N G N B i∈G E(H σ (i)) = 2N G N B N G N B 1 6 = 1 3 .</formula><p>Substituting E(K G ), E(K B ) and E(K GB ) with their obtained values in Eq. 6, we obtain the following quadratic equation in N G :</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">0 = 1 6 N 2 G − ( 1 2 − 1 3 N )N G − N (N − 1)( 1 2 −K). (8)</formula><p>There are two solutions to this equation; when 0 ≤K ≤ 1/2, we take the only solution in the range [0, N ]. WhenK &gt; 1/2, we set N G = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Partial Overlap</head><p>When the sequences are not fully overlapping (e.g., <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) the value of E(K GB ) depends on the nonoverlapping margins of the sequences, defined below. In this case, the estimation of N G given by Eq. 8 is an underestimation (see <ref type="bibr">Claim 2)</ref>. We next describe a method to estimate N G by computing the regions of overlap, using this observation.</p><p>Formally, the sequence [N ] is partitioned into three intervals: L 1 , O 1 , and R 1 , defined by the lowest, i 1 L , and highest, i 1 H , indexes of the correct matches. Similarly, we define L 2 , O 2 , and R 2 with the indexes i 2 L and i 2 H . Note that an index of an incorrect match, i ∈ O 1 ∩ B, is not necessarily matched to an index in O 2 . To use our results for the fully overlapped sequences (Sec. 4.2), we discard such indexes and define the fully overlapped subsequences, O = (Ô 1 ,Ô 2 ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">O 1 = {i | (i ∈ O 1 ) ∧ (σ(i) ∈ O 2 )} ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>andÔ 2 is the sequence of indexes of the matched features toÔ 1 . Note thatÔ 1 andÔ 2 are defined by the 4-tuple of indexes, ω * = (i 1 L , i 1 H , i 2 L , i 2 H ). Moreover, N , N G andK, on the subsequences defined by ω * are given by N (ω * ), N G (ω * ) andK(ω * ). We can now use these new values in Eq. 8 to obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">0 = 1 6 N 2 G (ω * ) − ( 1 2 − 1 3 N (ω * ))N G (ω * ) −N (ω * )(N (ω * ) − 1)( 1 2 −K(ω * )).<label>(10)</label></formula><p>In this case we claim the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Claim 2.</formula><p>The expected maximal value of N G (ω), for any ω, is obtained for ω = ω * , i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">max ω N G (ω) = N G (ω * ).<label>(11)</label></formula><p>We use assumptions A1-A3 to prove it (see the supplementary material). We use this claim to estimate ω * , which determines the region of overlap between the pair of images, as described below. Given ω * we can estimate the desired N G using Eq. 10.</p><p>Estimating ω * . To compute N G (ω * ), we need to consider all 4-tuples ω ∈ [1, . . . , N ] 4 . For efficiency, we consider only a small subset of intervals. Formally, we consider all intervals in the sequence of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">[i, j] = [t i q + 1, t j q]</formula><p>where 0 &lt; t i &lt; t j ≤ N/q are integers. The algorithm that considers all these intervals in I 1 and I 2 , we name K2D. To further improve efficiency, we propose the K1D algorithm which considers sequentially the intervals in each image.</p><p>That is, we first use the intervals, ω = (i 1 L , j 1 H , 1, N ), to sample the values of N G (ω). The resulting interval, [i 1 L , j 1 H ], is then used to fix the interval in I 1 and estimate the interval in I 2 ; that is, we use the intervals ω = (i 1 L , j 1 H , i 2 L , j 2 H ) to arrive at our final estimate for ω * and N G (ω * ).</p><p>Kendall distance computation. The Kendall distance can be computed in O(N log N ) time using the merge sort algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, applied on σ. The basic idea is that the number of inversions can be computed at the merge stage (when merging two sorted arrays into one). The number of inversions that should be added to the count is the number of elements that remain in the left array when the next minimal element is taken from the right array.</p><p>For partial overlap, maximizing the estimated value of N G (ω) in Eq. 11 requires multiple Kendall distance computations for various intervals. We compute these distances efficiently by first computing the Kendall distance for each of the non-overlapping intervals of size q using the merge sort algorithm. The Kendall distance of an interval of size dq is obtained by counting the inversions when merging two successive intervals of size d 1 q and d 2 q, where d 1 +d 2 = d.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Matching Probabilities</head><p>We propose to compute a probability, P K (i), that a match, m = (p i , q σ(i) ), is correct, given the computed H σ (i) (defined in Sec. 4.2) and our estimation of θ = (Ô 1 ,Ô 2 , N G ). This probability can then be used as a likelihood function for sampling matches, in particular in guided RANSAC methods.</p><p>When i / ∈Ô 1 or σ(i) / ∈Ô 2 we set P K (i) = 0 (or to a small value), since, by the definition ofÔ 1 andÔ 2 , i ∈ B.

For a full overlap, a typical graph of the number of order inversions, H σ (i), as a function of the index i is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>. For i ∈ B (blue dots), H σ (i) is approximately uniformly distributed in a range which depends on i. As expected from the analysis presented in Sec. 4.2, the distribution of i ∈ G (red dots) is around the function x(1−x), where x = i/N and N = |Ô 1 |.</p><p>To compute P K (i) for i ∈ G, we use the Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">P K (i) = P i ∈ G H σ (i) = P Hσ(i) i∈G P i∈G P Hσ(i) = P H|G P G P H|G P G +P H|B P B ,<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where P H|G = P H σ (i) i ∈ G , P H|B = P H σ (i) i / ∈ G , P G = P i ∈ G and P B = P i / ∈ G . We assume w.l.g. that there is a full overlap; hence, the probabilities P G = N G /N and P B = 1 − P G are given by the ratio of the correct and the incorrect matches to N , respectively.</p><p>We next describe our estimation of P H|G . Consider β = (β l 1 , β r 1 , β l 2 , β r 2 ) (defined in Sec. 4.2). Note that β r 1 and β r 2 are given directly from β l 1 , β l 2 , N , and the estimated N G . Since β is unknown, we compute P H|G using the law of total probability over the set of possible values, β ∈ S β :</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">P (H σ (i)|i ∈ G) = β∈S β P (H σ (i)|i ∈ G, β)P (β).</formula><p>For efficiency, only k values of β ∈ S β are considered by restricting the values of β l 1 and β l 2 to be around their expectations, (i − 1)P B and (σ(i) − 1)P B , respectively (in our implementation we set k = 5).</p><p>The probability P (β) is modeled as the product of two hypergeometric distributions, one for β l 1 and the other for β l 2 . Given a value for β, we model P (H σ (i)|i ∈ G, β) as a product of two hypergeometric distributions. In a similar way we estimate P (H σ (i)|i ∈ B, β). Substituting these terms into Eq. 12 yields P K (i). We approximate the hypergeometric PDFs by Gaussian PDFs with the same mean and standard deviation, and approximate P H|B as a uniform distribution whose boundaries we compute (see the supplementary material for the complete derivation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Experiments</head><p>Our method was tested on both synthetic and real data. For each dataset we tested the following algorithms. The first, which we refer to as K, is the basic one where N G is estimated using the entire sequence and ignoring the margins; that is, without first computing the overlap (see Sec. 4.2). The other two algorithms compute N G , O 1 and O 2 . One uses the joint sampling of intervals from I 1 and I 2 , while the other uses a separate sampling of intervals in I 1 and I 2 (see Sec. 4.3). These algorithms are referred to as K2D and K1D, respectively. For evaluation purpose we also consider KGT, where the ground truth of O 1 and O 2 are given, and compute only N G .</p><p>To evaluate the accuracy of N G we measure the normalized absolute error, µ(</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">N G ) = |N G − N GT G |/N , where N GT G</formula><p>is the ground truth.

The scatter plot of the four algorithms with respect to the ground truth is presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>. The K algorithm, where |O 1 | = |O 2 | = N is wrongly assumed, underestimates N G , and µ(N G ) is relatively large. The estimation using K2D and K1D are similar and slightly underestimate of N G . These results are probably due to the sampling used for estimating O 1 and O 2 , since for KGT, the errors are negligible. For both tests, K1D is almost an order of magnitude faster than K2D.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Applications</head><p>We next evaluate three applications of N G estimation.</p><p>Halting condition. The classic halting condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">Chapter 11.6]</ref> for adaptive RANSAC methods is based on the probability that at iteration t at least one consensus set was constructed from an uncontaminated minimal set of matches. This probability is computed as a function of the number of correct matches. As this number is usually unknown, the probability is updated when a larger consensus set is found. The method halts when the confidence in the solution is high based on the size of the consensus set. Since our algorithm is able to estimate N G , we are able to halt RANSAC instantly when a consensus set of at least N G matches has been found To test this we run USAC with and without the halting condition on all the datasets and compare the inlier rate and runtime (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>). The total runtime with the halting condition is 69% of the total runtime without the halting condition. This is achieved with nearly no loss of inliers (normalized absolute error of 0.78%).</p><p>SfM image pairs. A major time-consuming stage in the pipeline of SfM methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> is running RANSAC on all image pairs to filter out incorrect matches. We propose to run RANSAC only on image pairs with sufficiently large N G , avoiding spatially unrelated image pairs.</p><p>We use the dataset "Barcelona" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which consists of 191 images taken from all around a building. We consider the total number of inliers and the total runtime from running USAC on all image pairs as 100% of inliers and runtime. Our goal is to maintain the inliers, while reducing the runtime. We use a threshold, t, to discard image pairs for which our estimation of N G &lt; t, using the K2D and K1D algorithms. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6(a)&amp;(b)</ref> shows the reduction in inliers and runtime as a function of t.</p><p>For K2D, the total runtime decreases to 17% (or 4.5%) while maintaining 91% (or 86%) of the inliers. In both of these examples, all images remain with at least one other image for which the fundamental matrix could be calculated. For K1D, the total runtime decreases to 7% (or 1.2%!) while maintaining 87% (or 80%) of the inliers. In the second example only one image out of the 191 images was lost. Note that the percentage of time spent discarding matches outliers in a typical SfM method (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>) is ∼ 25 % of the total runtime.</p><p>Matching probability. Computing matching probabilities, P K , can be useful for several applications, including guided RANSAC. For evaluating our estimate for P K , we present the mean inlier precision of the x ≤ 200 highest ranked matches, given by P K <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6(c)</ref>). It is compared with the Lowe ranking ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>), denoted by P L . The mean precision was calculated on all image pairs from all datasets. The curve for the mean P K (green) is below the curve for the mean P L (red) for the first 50 matches, and then vice versa. A combination of the two probabilities, given by P C = P K P L P K P L +(1−P K )(1−P L ) . is the blue curve. Using low values of x, P C outperforms its components. For higher values of x, our estimation is better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In this paper we introduced a novel method to estimate the number of correct matches, and a method to estimate the region of overlap between a pair of images. We also derive a probability function for a match to be correct. All these were done using only the spatial order of a given set of matches, and some reasonable statistical assumptions. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this estimation on real datasets for an analysis of feature matches using only the spatial order of features in each image. Our method successfully competes with methods that compute the set of inliers explicitly by recovering the epipolar geometry, but at a much lower cost. It is impressive to see what can be learned about matching using only spatial orders.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 ..</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Correctly/incorrectly matched features are marked as green/yellow circles, respectively.

Middlebury Partial Overlap. The overlap between im-
age pairs in the Middlebury datasets is very large (about 
90% of the image). Therefore, we randomly vertically cut 
them to obtain smaller overlaps. This enables us to test the 
partial-overlap method (Sec. 4.3) against the ground truth 
(Tab. 2). These datasets are denoted by MPartial05&amp;06 and 
MPartial14 for Middlebury 2005&amp;2006 and 2014, respec-
tively. Both the errors of K2D and K1D are low and sim-
ilar to the full overlap case, demonstrating the success of 
the partial overlap method. However, the running time is 
much lower for K1D. The error, µ(N G ), is large for method
