<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Video has become ubiquitous on the Internet, broadcasting channels, as well as personal devices. This has encouraged the development of advanced techniques to analyze the semantic video content for a wide variety of applications. Recognition of videos has been a fundamental challenge of computer vision for decades. Previous research has predominantly focused on recognizing videos with a predefined yet very limited set of individual words. Thanks to the recent development of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), researchers have strived to automatically describe video content with a complete and natural sentence, which can be regarded as the ultimate goal of video understanding. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows the examples of video description generation. Given an input video, the generated sentences are to describe video content, ideally encapsulating its most informative dynamics. There is a wide variety of video applications based on the description, ranging from editing, indexing, search, to sharing. However, the problem itself has been taken as a grand challenge for decades in the research communities, as the description generation model should be powerful enough not only to recognize key objects from visual content, but also discover their spatio-temporal relationships and the dynamics expressed in a natural language.</p><p>Despite the difficulty of the problem, there have been a few attempts to address video description generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, and image caption generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, which are mainly inspired by recent advances in machine translation using RNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Among these successful attempts, most of them use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a variant of RNN, which can capture long-term temporal information by mapping sequences to sequences. Thus, we follow this elegant recipe and use LSTM as our RNN model to generate the video sentence in this paper.</p><p>However, existing approaches to video description generation mainly optimize the next word given the input video and previous words locally, while leaving the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and video content unexploited. As a result, the generated sentences can suffer from robustness problem. It is often the case that the output sentence from existing approaches may be contextually correct but the semantics (e.g., subjects, verbs or objects) in the sentence are not true. For example, the sentence generated by LSTM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> for the video in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is "a man is riding a horse," which is correct in logic but the subject "man" is not relevant to the video content.</p><p>To address the above issues, we leverage the semantics of the entire sentence and visual content to learn a visualsemantic embedding model, which holistically explores the relationships in between. Specifically, we present a novel Long Short-Term Memory with visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E) framework to bridge video content and natural language, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Given a video, a 2-D and/or 3-D Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) is utilized to extract visual features of selected video frames/clips, while the video representation is produced by mean pooling over these visual features. Then, a LSTM for generating video sentence and a visual-semantic embedding model are jointly learnt based on the video representation and sentence semantics. The spirit of LSTM-E is to generate video sentence from the viewpoint of mutual reinforcement between coherence and relevance. Coherence expresses the contextual relationships among the generated words with video content which is optimized in the LSTM, while relevance conveys the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and video content which is measured in the visual-semantic embedding. By jointly learning the coherence and relevance, the generated sentence is expected to be both contextually and semantically correct.</p><p>The contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>(1) We present an end-to-end deep model for automatic video description generation, which incorporates both visual appearance of video frames (2-D CNN) and temporal dynamics across frames (3-D CNN) for learning an effective spatio-temporal video representation.</p><p>(2) We propose a novel Long Shot-Term Memory with visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E) framework, which considers both the contextual relationship among the words in sentence, and the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and video content, for generating natural language of a given video.</p><p>(3) The proposed LSTM-E model is evaluated on the popular YouTube2Text corpus and outperforms the-stateof-the-art in terms of both Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triplet prediction and sentence generation. In addition, we also demonstrate that LSTM-E achieves superior performances in sentence generation on two larger movie description datasets, i.e., M-VAD and MPII-MD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>There are mainly two directions for translation from visual content. The first direction predefines the special rule for language grammar and split sentence into several parts (e.g., subject, verb, object). With such sentence fragments, many works align each part with visual content and then generate the sentence for corresponding visual content: <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> use Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to produce sentence for image and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, a Markov Random Field (MRF) model is proposed to attach a descriptive sentence to the given image. For video translation, Rohrbach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> learn a CRF to model the relationships between different components of the input video and generate descriptions for video. Guadarrama et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> use semantic hierarchies to choose an appropriate level of the specificity and accuracy of sentence fragments. This direction is highly depended on the templates of sentence and can only generate sentence with syntactical structure.</p><p>Another direction is to learn the probability distribution in the common space of visual content and textual sentence. In this direction, several works explore such probability distribution using topic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> to generate sentence more flexibly. Recently, most methods are proposed based on RNN. Kiros et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> firstly take the neural networks to generate sentence for image by proposing a multimodal log-bilinear neural language model. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Vinyals et al. propose an end-to-end neural networks system by utilizing LSTM to generate sentence for image. For video translation, an endto-end LSTM based model is also proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which only reads the sequence of video frames and then generates a natural sentence. The model is further extended by inputting both frames and optical flow in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Yao et al.</ref> propose to use a 3-D CNN for modeling video clip dynamic temporal structure and an attention mechanism to select the most relevant temporal clips <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Then, the resulting video representations are fed into the text-generating RNN.</p><p>Our work belongs to the second direction. However, most of the above approaches in this direction mainly focus on optimizing the contextual relationship among words to generate sentence given visual content, while the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and visual content is not fully explored. Our work is different that we claim to generate video sentence by jointly exploiting the two relationships, which characterize the complementary properties of coherence and relevance of a generated sentence, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Video Description with Relevance and Coherence</head><p>Our goal is to generate language sentences for videos. What makes a good sentence? Beyond describing important persons, objects, scenes, and actions by words, it should also convey how one word leads to the next. Specifically, we define a good sentence as a "coherent" chain of words in which each word influences the next through contex- The relevance loss is to measure the relationships between the semantics of the entire sentence and video content in the embedding space, while the coherence loss is to characterize the contextual relationships among the generated words in the sentence in LSTM. Both LSTM and visual-semantic embedding are jointly learnt by minimizing two losses. tual information. Furthermore, the semantics of the entire sentence must be "relevant" to the video content. We begin this section by presenting the problem formulation, and followed by the proposal of two losses on measuring coherence and relevance, which are two principles for making a natural and correct sentence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Problem Formulation</head><p>Suppose we have a video V with N v sample frames/clips (uniform sampling) to be described by a textual sentence S, where S = {w 1 , w 2 , ..., w N s } consisting of N s words. Let v ∈ R D v and w t ∈ R D w denote the D v -dimensional visual features of a video V and the D w -dimensional textual features of the t-th word in sentence S, respectively. As a sentence consists of a sequence of words, a sentence can be represented by a D w × N s matrix W ≡ [w 1 , w 2 , ..., w N s ], with each word in the sentence as its column vector. Furthermore, we denote another feature vector s in the text space for representing a sentence as a whole.</p><p>In the video description generation problem, on one hand, the generated descriptive sentence must be able to depict the main contents of a video precisely, and on the other, the words in the sentence should be organized coherently in language. Therefore, we can formulate the video description generation problem by minimizing the following energy loss function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E(V, S) = (1 − λ) × E r (v, s) + λ × E c (v, W) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where E r (v, s) and E c (v, W) are the relevance loss and coherence loss, respectively. The former measures the relevance degree of the video content and sentence semantics and we build a visual-semantic embedding for this purpose, which is introduced in Section 3.2. The latter estimates the contextual relationships among the generated words in the sentence and we use LSTM-type RNN as our model, which is presented in Section 3.3. The tradeoff between these two competing losses is captured by linear fusion with a positive parameter λ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Visual-Semantic Embedding: Relevance</head><p>In order to effectively represent the visual content of a video, we first use a 2-D and/or 3-D CNN, which is powerful to produce a rich representation of each sampled frame/clip from the video. Then, we perform "mean pooling" process over all the frames/clips to generate a single D v -dimensional vector v for each video V. The sentence feature s is produced by the feature vectors w t (t = 1, 2, ..., N s ) of each word in the sentence. We first encode each word w t as "one-hot" vector (binary index vector in a vocabulary), thus the dimension of feature vector w t , i.e. D w , is the vocabulary size. Then the binary TF weights are calculated over all words of the sentence to produce the integrated representation of the entire sentence, denoted by s ∈ R D w , with the same dimension as w t .</p><p>We assume that a low-dimensional embedding exists for the representation of video and sentence, which is widely used in image search <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> and image reranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The linear mapping function can be derived from this embedding by v e = T v v and s e = T s s,</p><p>where D e is the dimensionality of the embedding, and T v ∈ R D e ×D v and T s ∈ R D e ×D s are the transformation matrices that project the video content and semantic sentence into the common embedding, respectively.</p><p>To measure the relevance between the video content and semantic sentence, one natural way is to compute the distance between their mappings in the embedding. Thus, we define the relevance loss as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E r (v, s) = T v v − T s s 2 2 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>We strengthen the relevance between video content and semantic sentence by minimizing the relevance loss. As such, the generated sentence is expected to better manifest the semantics of videos.</p></div>

(5)</formula><p>By minimizing the coherence loss, the contextual relationship among the words in the sentence can be guaranteed, making the sentence coherent and smooth.</p><p>In video description generation task, both the relevance loss and coherence loss need to be estimated to complete the whole energy function.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Joint Modeling Embedding and Translation</head><p>Following the relevance and coherence criteria, this work proposes a Long Short-Term Memory with visualsemantic Embedding (LSTM-E) model for video description generation. The basic idea of LSTM-E is to translate the video representation from a 2-D and/or 3-D deep convolutional network to the desired output sentence by using LSTM-type RNN model. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows an overview of LSTM-E model. In particular, the training of LSTM-E is performed by simultaneously minimizing the relevance loss and coherence loss. Therefore, the formulation presented in Eq.(1) is equivalent to minimizing the following energy function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E(V, S) = (1 − λ) × T v v − T s s 2 2 − λ × N s t=0 log Pr ( w t | v, w 0 , . . . , w t−1 ; θ; T v ; T s ) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where θ are the parameters of our LSTM-E models.</p><p>In the following, we will first present the architecture of LSTM memory cell, followed by jointly modeling with visual-semantic embedding. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Long Short Term Memory</head><p>We will briefly introduce the standard LSTM, which addresses the vanishing gradients problem in traditional RN-N training. A diagram of the LSTM unit is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. It consists of a single memory cell, an input activation function, an output activation function, and three gates (input, forget and output). The hidden state of the cell is recurrently connected back to the input and three gates. The memory cell updates its hidden state by combining the previous cell state which is modulated by the forget gate and a function of the current input and the previous output, modulated by the input gate. The forget gate is a critical component of the LSTM unit, which can control what to be remembered and what to be forgotten by the cell and somehow can avoid the gradient from vanishing or exploding when back propagating through time. Having been updated, the cell state is mapped to (−1, 1) range through an output activation function which is necessary whenever the cell state is unbounded. Finally, the output gate determines how much of the memory cell flows into the output. These additions to the single memory cell enable LSTM to capture extremely complex and long-term temporal dynamics, which has also been applied to video classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>The vector formulas for a LSTM layer forward pass are given below. For timestep t, x t and h t are the input and output vector respectively, T are input weights matrices, R are recurrent weight matrices and b are bias vectors. Sigmoid σ and hyperbolic tangent φ are element-wise non-linear activation functions. The dot product and sum of two vectors are denoted with ⊙ and + , respectively. Given inputs x t , h t−1 and c t−1 , the LSTM unit updates for timestep t are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">g t = φ(T g x t + R g h t−1 + b g ) cell input i t = σ(T i x t + R i h t−1 + b i ) input gate f t = σ(T f x t + R f h t−1 + b f ) f orget gate c t = g t ⊙ i t + c t−1 ⊙ f t cell state o t = σ(T o x t + R o h t−1 + b o ) output gate h t = φ(c t ) ⊙ o t cell output .<label>(7)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">LSTM with Visual-Semantic Embedding</head><p>By further incorporating a visual-semantic embedding, our LSTM-E architecture is to jointly model embedding and translation. In the training stage, given the video-sentence pair, the inputs of LSTM are the representations of the video and the words in the sentence after mapping into the embedding. As mentioned above, here we train the LSTM model to predict each word in the sentence given the embedding of visual feature for video and previous words. There are multiple ways that can be used to combine the visual content and words in LSTM unit updating procedure. The first one is to feed the visual content at each time step as an extra input for LSTM to emphasize the visual content frequently among LSTM memory cells. The second one only inputs the visual content once at the initial step to inform the whole memory cells in LSTM about the visual content. As empirically verified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, feeding the image at each time yields inferior results, due to the fact that the network can explicitly exploit noise and overfits more easily. Therefore, we adopt the second approach to arrange the inputs into LSTM in our architecture. Given the video v and its corresponding sentence W ≡ [w 0 , w 1 , ..., w N s ], the LSTM updating procedure is as following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x −1 = T v v (8) x t = T s w t , t ∈ {0, . . . , N s − 1} (9) h t = f x t , t ∈ {0, . . . , N s − 1}<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where f is the updating function within LSTM unit. Please note that for the input sentence W ≡ {w 0 , . . . , w N s }, we take w 0 as the start sign word to inform the beginning of sentence and w N s as the end sign word which indicates the end of sentence, both of the special sign words are included in our vocabulary. Most specifically, at the initial time step, the video representation in the embedding is set as the input for LSTM, and then in the next steps, word embedding x t will be input into the LSTM along with the previous step's hidden state h t−1 . In each time step (except the initial step), we use the LSTM cell output h t to predict the next word.</p><p>Here a softmax layer is applied after the LSTM layer to produce a probability distribution over all the D s words in the vocabulary as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Pr t+1 (w t+1 ) = exp T (wt+1) h h t w∈W exp T (w) h h t ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where W is the word vocabulary space, T (w) h is the parameter matrix in softmax layer. Therefore, we can obtain the next word based on such probability distribution until the end sign word is emitted. Accordingly, we define our loss function as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">E(V, S) = (1 − λ) × T v v − T s s 2 2 − λ × N s t=1 log Pr t (w t ) .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Let N denote the number of video-sentence pairs in the training set, we have the following optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">min T v ,T s ,T h ,θ 1 N N i=1 E(V (i) , S (i) ) + T v 2 2 + T s 2 2 + T h 2 2 + θ 2 2 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where the first term is the combination of the relevance loss and coherence loss, while the rest are regularization terms for video embedding, sentence embedding, softmax layer and LSTM, respectively. The above overall objective is optimized over the whole training video-sentence pairs using stochastic gradient descent. By minimizing this objective function, our LSTM-E model takes into account both the contextual relationships among the words in sentence (coherence) and the relationships between the semantics of the entire sentence and video content (relevance). For sentence generation, we choose the word with maximum probability at each timestep and set its embedded feature as LSTM input for next timestep until the end sign word is outputted.</p></div>

The two datasets are both composed of Hollywood movie snippets with descriptions from movie scripts or audio descriptions. Specifically, M-VAD contains about 49,000 video clips from 92 movies and MPII-MD contains about 68,000 video clips from 94 movies.</p><p>We compare our LSTM-E approach with two 2-D CN-N of AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the 19-layer VGG <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> network both pre-trained on Imagenet ILSVRC12 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and one 3-D CNN of C3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> pre-trained on Sports-1M video dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.

The dimensionality of the visualsemantic embedding space and the size of hidden layer in LSTM are both set to 512.

Furthermore, a weighted attention mechanism is used to dynamically attend to specific temporal regions of the video while generating sentence.</p><p>(7) Sequence to Sequence -Video to Text (S2VT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>: S2VT incorporates both RGB and optical flow inputs, and the encoding and decoding of the inputs and word representations are learnt jointly in a parallel manner.  E (C3D), and LSTM-E (VGG+C3D). The input frame/clip features of the first three runs are from AlexNet, VGG and C3D network respectively. The input of the last one is to concatenate the features from VGG and C3D.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Evaluation of SVO Triplet Prediction</head><p>As SVO triples can capture the compositional semantics of videos, predicting SVO triplet could indicate the quality of a translation system to a large extent. We adopt SVO accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> which measures the exactness of SVO words by binary (0-1 loss), as the evaluation metric. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> details SVO accuracy of compared nine models on YouTube2Text. Within these models, the former four models (called Item driven models) explicitly optimize to identify the best subject, verb and object items for a video; while the later five models (named Sentence driven models) focus on training on objects and actions jointly in a sentence and learn to interpret these in different contexts. For the later five sentence driven models, we extract the SVO triplets from the generated sentences by Stanford Parser 1 and the words are also stemmed. Overall, the results across SVO triplet indicate that almost all the four Item driven models exhibit better performance than LST-M model which predicts the next word by only considering the contextual relationships with the previous words given the video content. By jointly modeling the relevance between the semantics of the entire sentence and video content with LSTM, LSTM-E significantly improves LSTM. Furthermore, the performances of LSTM-E (VGG), LSTM-E (C3D), and LSTM-E (VGG+C3D) on Subject, Verb and Object are all above that of the four Item driven models. The result basically indicates the advantage of further exploring the relevance holistically between the semantics of the entire sentence and video content in addition to LSTM.</p><p>Compared to LSTM-E (Alex), LSTM-E (VGG) using a more powerful frame representation brought by a deeper CNN exhibits significantly better performance. In addition, LSTM-E (C3D) which has a better ability in encapsulating temporal information leads to better performance than LSTM-E (VGG) in terms of Verb prediction accuracy. When combining the features from VGG and C3D, LSTM-E (VGG+C3D) further increases the performance gains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.3">Evaluation of Sentence Generation</head><p>For item driven models including FGM, CRF, CCA and JEM, the sentence generation is often performed by leveraging a series of simple sentence templates (or special language trees) on the SVO triplets <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Having verified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, using LSTM architecture can lead to a large performance boost against the template-based sentence generation. Thus, <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> only shows comparisons of LSTMbased sentence generations on YouTube2Text. We use the BLEU@N <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and METEOR scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> against all ground truth sentences. Both metrics have been shown to correlate well with human judgement, and widely used in machine translation literature. Specifically, BLEU@N measures the fraction of N -gram (up to 4-gram) that are in common between a hypothesis and a reference or set of references, while METEOR computes unigram precision and recall, extending exact word matches to include similar words based on WordNet synonyms and stemmed tokens. As shown in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, the qualitative results across different N of BLEU and METEOR consistently indicate that the LSTM-E (Alex) significantly outperforms the traditional LSTM model. Moreover, we can find that the performance gain of BLEU@N becomes larger when N increases, where N measures the length of the contiguous sequence in the sentence. This again confirms that LSTM-E is benefited from the way of holistically exploring the relationships between the semantics of the entire sentence and video content by minimizing the distance of their mappings in the visual-semantic embedding. Similar to the observations in SVO prediction task, our LSTM-E (VGG) outperforms LSTM-E (Alex) and reach 29.5% METEOR. Furthermore, LSTM-E (C3D) achieves 29.9% METEOR and improves the performance to 31.0% when combined with VGG, which makes the improvement over the two state-ofthe-art methods SA by 4.7% and S2VT by 4.0%, respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> shows a few sentence examples generated by different methods and human-annotated ground truth. From these exemplar results, it is easy to see that all of these automatic methods can generate somewhat relevant sentences. When looking into each word, both LSTM-E (Alex) and LSTM-E (VGG+C3D) predict more relevant Subject, Verb and Object (SVO) terms. For example, compared to subject term "a man," "people" and "a group of people" are more precise to describe the video content in the second video. Similarly, verb term "singing" presents the fourth video more exactly. The predicted object term "motorcycle" is more relevant than "car" in fifth video. Moreover, LSTM-E (VGG+C3D) can offer more coherent sentences. For instance, the generated sentence "a man is talking on a phone" of the third video encapsulates the video content more clearly.</p><p>We also evaluate our best run, LSTM-E (VGG+C3D) on two movie description datasets M-VAD and MPII-MD. The high diversity of visual and textual content in movie datasets makes the sentence generation task especially challenging. The METEOR scores on M-VAD and MPII-MD are given in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Our LSTM-E (VGG+C3D) approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both movie datasets. In particular, the METEOR scores on M-VAD and MPII-MD of LSTM-E (VGG+C3D) can achieve 0.067 and 0.073, which make the relative improvement over the best competitor S2VT by 19.6% and 15.9%. Please note that on MPII-MD, we include the performance of SMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which translates detected essential components into sentence description by CRF as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Experimental Analysis</head><p>We further analyze the effect of the tradeoff parameter λ between two losses, and the size of hidden layer in LSTM learning for sentence generation task on YouTube2Text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">The Tradeoff Parameter λ</head><p>To clarify the effect of the tradeoff parameter λ in Eq.(12), we illustrate the performance curves with a different tradeoff parameter in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>. To make all performance curves   </p><p>where m λ and m ′ λ denote original and normalized performance values (BLEU@N or METEOR), respectively.</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>, we can see that all performance curves are like the "∧" shapes when λ varies in a range from 0.1 to 0.9. The best performance is achieved when λ is about 0.7. This proves that it is reasonable to jointly learn the visual-semantic embedding space in the deep RNNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">The Size of Hidden Layer of LSTM</head><p>In order to show the relationship between the performance and hidden layer size of LSTM, we compare the results of the hidden layer size in the range of 128, 256, 512 and 1024. The results shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref> indicate increasing the hidden layer size can generally lead to performance improvements. Meanwhile, the number of parameters increases exponentially. Therefore, in our experiments, the hidden layer size is empirically set to 512 as it has a better tradeoff between performance and model complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussions and Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed a novel model named LSTM-E to generate video description. In particular, a visual-semantic embedding space is additionally incorporated into LSTM learning. In this way, a global relationship between the video content and sentence semantics is simultaneously measured in addition to the local contextual relationship between the word at each step and the previous ones in LSTM learning. On the popular YouTube2Text dataset, the results of our experiments demonstrate the success of our approach, outperforming the current state-ofthe-art models with a significantly large margin on both SVO prediction and sentence generation. Moreover, Our LSTM-E also achieves superior performance on two largescale and challenging movie description datasets.</p><p>Our future works are as follows. First, as a video itself is a temporal sequence, the way of better representing the videos by using RNN will be further explored. Moreover, the video description generation might be significantly boosted if we could have sufficient labeled video-sentence pairs to train a deeper RNN.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Examples of video description generation.</figDesc></figure>
