<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Automatic tracking of large-scale crowded targets are of particular importance in many applications, such as crowded people/vehicle tracking in video surveillance, fiber tracking in materials science, and cell tracking in biomedical imaging. This problem becomes very challenging when the targets show similar appearance and the interslice/inter-frame continuity is low due to sparse sampling, camera motion and target occlusion. The main challenge comes from the step of association which aims at matching the predictions and the observations of the multiple targets. In this paper we propose a new groupwise method to explore the target group information and employ the within-group correlations for association and tracking. In particular, the within-group association is modeled by a nonrigid 2D Thin-Plate transform and a sequence of group shrinking, group growing and group merging operations are then developed to refine the composition of each group. We apply the proposed method to track large-scale fibers from microscopy material images and compare its performance against several other multi-target tracking methods. We also apply the proposed method to track crowded people from videos with poor inter-frame continuity. * Indicates equal contribution.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Automatic tracking of large-scale crowded targets has been attracting more and more attention in the computer vision community for its important applications. In video surveillance, tracking of all the individual persons in a crowd can promote the public security <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> by detecting the group behaviors and individual anomalies. In materials science, accurate tracking of large-scale fibers from a sequence of serial sectioned slices of a composite material can facilitate the fast characterization of its underlying microstructure and accelerate the new material design and de-velopment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In biomedical imaging, accurately tracking the motion paths of the large-scale cells can provide important information for computer aided diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>One main challenge of the crowded target tracking lies in the step of association, which aims at matching the predictions and the observations of the multiple targets at a new slice/frame. In many applications, such as cell and fiber tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, different targets may share similar appearance, which increases the chances of the mis-association. In addition, many of the above applications may generate image sequences with low inter-frame/inter-slice continuity, which increases the gap between a prediction and its corresponding observation and further increases the misassociation rate. For example, in both biomedical and material imaging, it is highly desired to perform sparse sampling along the image sequence for fast imaging. In crowded human tracking, sudden movement of the camera, which is common when using wearable cameras, together with target occlusions, may also produce video clips with low interframe continuity.</p><p>In this paper, we develop a new groupwise association method to enable the tracking of large-scale crowded targets with similar appearance from low continuity image sequences. We explore the target groups in a way that the targets in a same group show relatively consistent motions and therefore, the tracking of the targets in a same group shows high level of correlation. Specifically, we utilize a 2D nonrigid Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) transform to describe the mapping between the predictions and the associated observations within a same group. However, the group composition of the targets are unknown priorly. To address this issue, we develop a new algorithm that clusters the targets into groups, following by three steps of group refinement: shrinking, growing and merging. The proposed method can handle false positives and false negatives in the observations, i.e., the numbers of predictions and observations may be different in the association.</p><p>In this paper we choose the task of fiber tracking from a sequence of microscopy material images for algorithm development. The fiber tracking is a typical crowded track-ing problem that possesses all the challenges as described above: 1) the fibers are highly crowded and of large scale, 2) all the fibers on the 2D slice are of similar appearance and bear a similar ellipsoidal shape, and 3) fast material imaging requires the sampled image sequence to be as sparse as possible, which leads to low inter-slice continuity. Given the ellipsoidal shape of the fiber in each slice, we can simply apply ellipse-detection algorithms to compute the fiber observations and focus our work on addressing the association problem. In the experiment, we test the proposed method on real material image sequences and evaluate the fiber tracking performance against the human annotated ground-truth fiber tracks. In particular, we evaluate the fiber tracking performance at different sampling sparsity along the image sequence. In the experiment, we also apply the proposed method to track crowded people with low inter-frame continuity.</p><p>For the remainder of the paper, Section 2 briefly reviews the related work. Section 3 describes the proposed method. Experiment results are presented in Section 4, followed by conclusions in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Both recursive and non-recursive methods were developed for multi-target tracking. Recursive tracking methods estimate the state of the target in a new slice (frame for videos) only using the information from previous slices that have been processed. Typical recursive tracking methods include the classical Kalman filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, Particle filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> and non-parametric mixture Particle filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. When tracking moves to a new slice, these recursive methods first make a prediction of the state for each target, then build association between predictions and observations of multiple targets, and finally correct the states using observations. Non-recursive tracking methods assume the availability of the whole image sequence before tracking multiple targets over this sequence. In these methods, observations of multiple targets are first detected on all the slices and then linked across slices along the image sequence for the final tracks by optimizing certain cost functions, such as maximum a posteriori (MAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, motion dynamics similarity is incorporated into the cost function, resulting in a non-recursive SMOT tracking method for multi-target video tracking. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, a KTH tracking method is developed by searching shortest path in the constructed graph model and this method was successfully used to track living cells in biomedical imaging. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, a CEM tracking method was proposed by optimizing a continuous cost function that considers the detection, appearance, motion priors, and physical constraints of the targets.</p><p>For recursive methods, association is usually formulated as an explicit step which finds the matching between the predictions and the observations. For non-recursive methods, the association is implied in the cost function and the optimization algorithm -the extracted paths find the associations between the observations across neighboring slices. Most of the existing work on multi-target tracking, especially the non-recursive methods, handle only small number of scattered targets with different appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, new models and methods have been developed for crowd tracking and analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Many of these methods employ tracklets or trajectories, which are extracted by optical flow and/or the local appearance matching across frames. These methods require very good inter-slice/inter-frame continuity. Differently, this paper is focused on tracking large-scale, crowded, similarappearance targets from low-continuity image sequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Proposed Method</head><p>As mentioned above, we present the proposed method using large-scale fiber tracking from a material image sequence. For simplicity, we use the Kalman filter to track each fiber, by recursively performing prediction, association and correction along the image sequence. The key contribution of this paper is the development of a new groupwise algorithm for association, which enables the developed method to track along low-continuity image sequences. The pipeline of the proposed tracking algorithm is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.1</ref>.</p><p>When the tracking moves to a new slice, we first compute a set of fiber observations from this new slice. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.1</ref>, most of the fibers are of an ellipse shape in the 2D slices and can be detected using an ellipse detection algorithm. In this paper, we first apply the EM/MPM algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to segment the image slice into fiber and non-fiber regions and then fit an ellipse to each connected component of the fiber region <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We take the locations (the center coordinates) of the fitted ellipses as the fiber observations and use them for association and tracking. In addition to the locations, we also record the tight bounding box around each fitted ellipse, which are used by several comparison methods in the later experiment. Given the image noise and blurs, observations contain both false positives and negatives.</p><p>In using Kalman filter for tracking each fiber, we define the tracking state s = (x, y, v x , v y ) T to describe the tracked fiber in 2D slices, where z = (x, y) T is the fiber location (e.g., ellipse center) and (v x , v y ) is the fiber velocity (e.g., inter-slice fiber location change). We set the state transition matrix to be   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Thin-Plate Spline Robust Point Matching (TPS-RPM) [8]</head><p>In this section, we briefly review the Thin-Plate Spline Robust Point Matching (TPS-RPM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which we will use to develop the proposed groupwise association algorithm. TPS-RPM can robustly match two sets of 2D points by exploring the correlations among these points. Specifically, let U = {u p } N p=1 and V = {v q } M q=1 be two sets of 2D points, i.e., u p = (u px, u py ), p = 1, 2, · · · , N and v q = (v qx, v qy ), q = 1, 2, · · · , M . The matching between these two sets of points is represented by a matrix H = [h p,q ] N ×M , where h p,q = [0, 1] indicates the probability of matching u p and v q . TPS-RPM can jointly determine a non-rigid 2D transform f = (f x , f y ) : R 2 → R 2 and the matrix H to minimize a cost function</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E T P S−RP M (H, f ) = N p=1 M q=1 h pq f (u p ) − v q 2 + + αφ(f ) + β N p=1 M q=1 h pq log h pq − γ N p=1 M q=1 h pq ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">φ(f ) = [L(f x ) + L(f y )] dxdy is the TPS bending energy [3, 8] with L(·) = ∂ 2 ∂x 2 2 + 2 ∂ 2 ∂x∂y 2 + ∂ 2 ∂y 2 2</formula><p>and it reflects the smoothness of the 2D mapping f -the smaller the φ(f ) , the smoother the mapping f . The cost function is alternately minimized in terms of H and f until convergence. Finally the obtained matrix H is thresholded to build the point matching between U and V. By introduc-ing the last two terms in the cost function, TPS-RPM can handle the noise and identify points without matchings. Fibers are usually implanted in bundles. On one hand, the fibers in different bundles are not correlated and the association of fibers in different bundles cannot be well modeled by a single TPS transform. On the other hand, for the fibers in the same bundle, they show good proximity and parallelism in 3D space and therefore, a smooth TPS transform, such as the one computed using TPS-RPM, may well describe such a within-bundle fiber association, especially in sparsely sampled image sequences. The problem is that the bundle compositions are unknown priorly. In this section, we develop a new approach that can simultaneously explore the fiber-bundle composition and the fiber association. Without knowing the bundle composition, we first cluster all the predictions into smaller groups, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref> (a) (b) <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. An illustration of finding the initial matching. (a) One group of predictions (in red) and (b) Sliding windows across the slice with observations: the optimal window with the best matching is shown in red. by using the K-means algorithm. While each fiber predictionŝ p is a 4D vector made up of a 2D location and a 2D velocity, we only cluster in terms of the locations</p></div>

However, the observations are not divided into corresponding groups as for the predictions. We use a sliding-window strategy to address this issue. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, for each group of predictions, shown by red circles, we derive its bounding box (in blue). Then we apply the sliding window of the size of the bounding box, dilated by 5 pixels, on the slice with the observations and perform TPS-RPM between the group of prediction against the observations in each of the sliding window. The sliding window that leads to the minimum cost E T P S−RP M is taken as the optimal window, shown by the red box in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, and the matched observations in this window are taken as the matching to the considered group of predictions. Similarly, we only consider 2D locationẑ p when applying the TPS-RPM for matching.</p><p>After applying such a sliding-window based matching for each group of predictions, we find its corresponding matched group of the observations and construct an initial association between the predictions and the observations. However, K-means clustering cannot guarantee the predictions from a same group are all from a same bundle and the initial association from TPS-RPM in such a group may not be reliable. In the following, we propose an algorithm to refine this initial association result.</p></div>

Without loss of generality, let (ŝ p , o p ), p = 1, 2, · · · , m be one matched group of predictions and observations, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4(a)</ref>. To identify and remove the outlier matching pairs from this group, we calculate the TPS bending energy as in Eq. (1) for this matching, in a  matrix form <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> φ , respectively. We calculate the leave-one-pair-out TPS bending energy φ j = φ ((ŝ p , o p ) |p = 1, 2, · · · , m; p = j), j = 1, 2, · · · , m and remove the j * -th pair that leads to the largest decrease of bending energy, i.e., j * = arg min j φ j . We repeat this process until a specified percentage (δ) of pairs are removed from each group, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 4</ref>. Note that, by prespecifying the percentage δ, the step of group shrinking may remove true positive matchings from a group. This will be handled in the later steps of group growing and group merging. After the group shrinking, we can construct a TPS map-ping for the matching in each group. Without loss of generality, let (ŝ q , o q ), q = 1, 2, · · · , n be one matched group of predictions and observations after group shrinking. We derive the TPS transform f = (f x , f y ) such that o q = f (ẑ q ), q = 1, 2, · · · , n.

Group growing is performed for each matching group (after the group shrinking) independently. Without loss of generality, let's consider a matching group (ŝ q , o q ), q = 1, 2, · · · , n shown by the dashedline linked boxes (predictions) and circles (observations) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 5(a)</ref>. The iterative growing of this group takes the following steps:</p><p>1. Label the predictionsŝ q , q = 1, 2, · · · , n as "processed" and all the other predictions as "unprocessed".</p><p>Compute the TPS transform f using Eq. (3).</p><p>2. From all the "unprocessed" predictions that are adjacent to the matching group in the Delaunay triangulation graph, identify the nearest one and denote it asŝ a with the locationẑ a . If all predictions adjacent to the matching group have been "processed", exit and return the matching group as the group growing result.</p><p>3. Apply TPS transform f toẑ a and search for the observation o a that is nearest to f (ẑ a ).</p><p>4. Check the consistency of the pair (ŝ a , o a ) against the matching group. If the consistency conditions are satisfied, we update the matching group by including the <ref type="figure">pair (ŝ a , o a )</ref> . Relabel the predictions in the updated matching group as "processed" and all the other predictions as "unprocessed". Recalculate the TPS transform f using the updated matching group and go back to Step 2. If any consistency condition is not satisfied, simply labelŝ a as "processed" and go back to Step 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref>(b) shows a group-growing result, starting from the matching group given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 5(a)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we define two consistency conditions between a pair (ŝ a , o a ) and a matching group (ŝ q , o q ), q = 1, 2, · · · , n. First, we compute the distribution of the prediction-observation gap (o q −ẑ q ), q = 1, 2, · · · , n in the matching group and examine whether the gap (o a −ẑ a ) shows high likelihood in this distribution. More specifically, the gap is a 2D vector and we estimate two Gaussian distributions for the magnitude and slope angle, respectively. The first consistency condition is that the gap (o a −ẑ a ) falls in L T times the standard deviations in both magnitude and slope angle distributions. Second, adding a new pair to a matching group may increase the TPS bending energy for the matching group. A small bendingenergy increase, i.e., φ ((ŝ q , o q ) |q = a, 1, 2, · · · , n) − φ ((ŝ q , o q ) |q = 1, 2, · · · , n) ≤ ∆ φ , is taken as the other consistency condition. If both consistency conditions are satisfied, we update the matching group by including the new pair as stated in Step 4. Note that Gaussian distributions used in consistency conditions are also updated when the matching group is updated in the group growing.</p><p>After applying the group growing independently to all the matching groups, one prediction may be matched to different observations in different matching groups and vice versa. We perform a group merging for the final association by applying two rounds of majority voting. In the first round, for each predictionŝ p , the number of the votes an observation o q receives is the number of matching groups that contain the pair (ŝ p , o q ) after group growing. The observation with the largest number of votes is matched toŝ p . In the second round, for each observation o q we vote similarly for its corresponding prediction by only considering the matching pairs that are kept after the first round of voting. After these two rounds of voting, the resulting matching pairs are guaranteed to be one-on-one: No two observations are matched to a same prediction and vice versa. We take these final matching pairs as the final association.</p><p>The whole groupwise TPS association algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>In the experiments, we apply the proposed method to track large-scale fibers from S200, an amorphous SiNC matrix reinforced by continuous Nicalon fibers. Three sets of data, denoted as Data 1, Data 2 and Data 3, are collected, each of which is a 100-slice image sequence with dense inter-slice distance 1µm. The size of each slice is 1292 × 968. A sample slice is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2(a)</ref>, which contains hundreds of crowded fibers. On the collected data, we annotate the locations of fibers on each slice and link them across slices as the ground truth for performance evaluation.</p><p>We use five widely used metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> for evaluating the fiber tracking performance: Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP), Identity Switches (IDSW), Mostly Tracked (MT) and Mostly Lost (ML), all of which measure the co-alignment between the tracked fibers and the annotated ground-truth fibers. Among these metrics, MOTA is a comprehensive one that considers both IDSW, false positives and false negatives. IDSW, MT and ML only reflect the tracking performance from specific perspectives. In computing these metrics, we use a threshold of 20 pixels between the tracked fiber and the ground-truth fiber on each slice to count the hit/miss on the slice. MT is the number of ground-truth fibers that are hit in no less than 80% of slices while ML is the number of ground-truth fibers that are hit in no more than 20% of slices. For MOTA and MT, the higher the better, and for MOTP, IDSW and ML, the lower the better. Note that, we follow the distance-based MOTP definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and a lower MOTP indicates a better tracking.</p><p>To test the tracking performance under sparsely sampled image sequences, we downsample the original image sequence. In particular, we skip C ≥ 0 slices before taking the next slice in the original sequence, until the end of original sequence is reached, to construct such sparsely sampled image sequences. For convenience, we name parameter C the sparsity: The larger the parameter C, the lower the interslice continuity of the constructed image sequence. One issue is that, such constructed image sequences with large C are much shorter than the original image sequence and the tracking performance obtained on a single such short sequence may not be statistically reliable. To alleviate this issue, for a given sparsity C we construct C + 1 image sequences, starting from original slice 1, 2, · · · , C + 1 respectively. These C + 1 image sequences do not share any slice. We perform tracking on each of them independently and then average their performances, e.g., MOTA and MOTP, as the performance of tracking under the sparsity C. Note that when C = 0, tracking is directly performed and evaluated on a single image sequence: the original densely sampled image sequence. In our experiments, we continuously vary the sparsity C from 0 to 19 and examine the tracking performance under different sparsity.</p><p>To justify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare its performance against three baseline Kalman filter methods and four other state-of-the-art multi-target tracking methods. For the three baseline methods, Kalman-NN, Kalman-Hung and Kalman-Global, they all follow the same Kalman filter setting as in the proposed Kalman-Groupwise method. The difference lies in the step of association. Kalman-NN uses the nearest neighboring (NN) search for association. More specifically, the pair of the prediction and observation with the minimum distance is identified and associated. Then we exclude this identified pair and repeat the same NN search on the remaining predictions and observations, until either predictions or observations are empty. Kalman-Hung computes the association using Hungarian algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> for a minimum-total-distance bipartite matching. Because the number of predictions and observations are usually different, we introduce dummy nodes into Hungarian algorithm. The distance to a dummy node is set to 40 pixels in our experiments. Kalman-Global computes the association by directly applying TPS-RPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to match the predictions and observations in a global fashion. The four other multi-target tracking algorithms used for comparison are DPNMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, SMOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, CEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and KTH <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. As reviewed in Section 2, these four are all non-recursive tracking methods.</p><p>For the Kalman-based methods, including the three baseline methods and the proposed Kalman-Groupwise, the initial state covariance is set to be a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements 10 3 . The transition noise covariance is set to be a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements 10 −3 . The observation noise covariance is set to be a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements 10 −3 . In the proposed Kalman-Groupwise, predictions are always clustered to 10 groups and the percentage of removed fiber pairs in group shrinking is set to δ = 30%. The consistency thresholds in group growing are set to L T = 3 and ∆ φ = 0.01. For the four non-recursive methods, we use the code downloaded from their authors' websites. For DPNMS, SMOT and CEM, the observations are the bounding boxes of the detected ellipses as described in Section 3. For KTH, no source code is available and we only have its binary executable file, which has its own integrated image segmentation and target detection components. For these four comparison methods, we use their default parameters for experiments.</p></div>

We can see that, when the sparsity C is low, both the proposed   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 6</ref> shows the MOTA and MOTP of the proposed method and the four non-recursive tracking methods: DPNMS, SMOT, CEM and KTH. All the four comparison methods show low MOTA values when the sparsity increases, because the crowded targets with similar appearance and the low continuity between slices break some basic assumptions made in these methods. In terms of MOTP, the proposed Kalman-Groupwise, SMOT, and DP-NMS are better (e.g., with lower MOTP values) than CEM and KTH. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows the IDSW, MT and ML metrics of the proposed Kalman-Groupwise and all the comparison methods. The performance shown in this table is the average over all three test image sequences. In general, the proposed Kalman-Groupwise shows competitive performance than these comparison methods when the sparsity C is high. In particular, compared to other comparison methods, the proposed Kalman-Groupwise is the only one that always keeps small IDSW, high MT and low ML when increasing sparsity C. DPNMS shows very high MT and low ML but suffers from very high IDSW. This indicates that DPNMS makes many mis-associations between frames.</p><p>For the running time, the proposed method processes 0.023 slices per second on a workstation with a 4-core 2.6GHz Intel CPU and 8GB memory. It can be accelerated substantially by parallelizing the matching on different fiber groups. We also study the selection of the cluster numbers in group initialization. We tried the group numbers from 8 to 16 on one fiber dataset with sparsity C=19. The obtained mean MOTA is 85.6% with standard deviation 5.8%, indicating that the proposed method is not very sensitive to the choice of cluster number.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Crowded Human Tracking</head><p>The proposed method can be used for tracking crowded people from videos. Analogue to fiber bundles, crowded people usually move in groups where people in the same group usually move toward similar directions with similar velocities and their association can be modeled by a TPS transform. While videos usually show good inter-frame continuity, there are several important cases where such inter-frame continuity may get very poor. First, the camera may move suddenly and then get back to look at the  same crowd of people. This is very common with the use of wearable cameras, such as Google Glass and GoPro. Second, the crowded targets may be occluded for a while and then re-appear in the view. In both cases, we need to track over low-continuity frames, analogue to the sparse sampled image sequences in fiber tracking. We use two videos with crowded people, downloaded from internet, to test the proposed method: Marathon and Band, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 7</ref>. Similar to fiber tracking, we simulate the low-continuity videos by sparse sampling: skipping a random number of frames (1 to 100) before taking a new frame for tracking. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 7</ref>, the frame numbers on the original video are shown at the bottom-left corner of the frame. Observations shown as white boxes are obtained by a trained DPM detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, followed by manual adjustments and corrections. After the sparse sampling, we choose 32 people to track on Marathon and 124 people to track for Band, as labeled by pink boxes on the starting frame as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Fig. 7</ref>. Their tracking results on subsequent frames are shown by numbered color boxes: the boxes with an identifical color and number across frames represent one resulting track. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows the MOTA tracking performance on these two sparsely sampled videos by using the proposed Kalman-Groupwise and other comparison methods. KTH is not applicable to this task because we only have its executable file which detects and tracks only objects with a simple shape of cells (e.g., fibers), but not human.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">#0 #20 #25 #38 #40 #0 #20 #25 #38 #40 #725 #825 #830 #725 #825 #830</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we proposed a groupwise association algorithm for tracking similar-appearance, crowded targets along low-continuity image sequences. The proposed algorithm divides targets in groups and employs the nonrigid Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) to model the within-group association. Without knowing the group compositions priorly, we applied K-means clustering to initialize the groups and then developed a three-step algorithm, consisting of group shrinking, group growing and group merging, for refining the initial groups. By integrating this association algorithm into Kalman filter, we used it to track large-scale crowded fibers from sparsely sampled material image sequences. We also showed the application of the proposed method to track crowded people from low-continuity videos. Results showed that the proposed method outperforms several baseline Kalman filters and multi-target tracking methods.</p></div>
