Of all these tasks, object proposals have been particularly successful in object detection systems. For example, nearly all top-performing entries <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> in the ImageNet Detection Challenge 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> used object proposals. They are preferred over the formerly used sliding window paradigm due to their computational efficiency. Objects present in an image may vary in location, size, and aspect ratio. Performing an exhaustive search over such a high dimensional space is difficult. By using object proposals, computational effort can be focused on a small number of candidate windows.</p><p>The focus of this paper is the protocol used for evaluating object proposals. Let us begin by askingwhat is the purpose of an object proposal algorithm?</p><p>In early works <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, the emphasis was on category independent object proposals, where the goal is to identify instances of all objects in the image irrespective of their category. While it can be tricky to precisely define what an "object" is 1 , these early works presented cross-category evaluations to establish and measure category independence.</p><p>More recently, object proposals are increasingly viewed as detection proposals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> where the goal is to improve the object detection pipeline, focusing on a chosen set of object classes (e.g.~20 PASCAL categories). In fact, many modern proposal methods are learning-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> where the definition of an "object" is the set of annotated classes in the dataset. This increasingly blurs the boundary between a proposal algorithm and a detector.</p><p>Notice that the former definition has an emphasis on object discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, while the latter definition emphasises on the ultimate performance of a detection pipeline. Surprisingly, despite the two different goals of 'object pro-  typically in terms of 'recall' of the annotated instances. Commonly used metrics are described in Section 3.</p><p>The central thesis of this paper is that the current evaluation protocol for object proposal methods is suitable for object detection pipeline but is a 'gameable' and misleading protocol for category independent tasks. By evaluating only on a specific set of object categories, we fail to capture the performance of the proposal algorithms on all the remaining object categories that are present in the test set, but not annotated in the ground truth. While intuitive (and somewhat obvious) in hindsight, we believe this is a crucial finding because it makes the current protocol 'gameable' or susceptible to manipulation (both intentional and unintentional) and misleading for measuring improvement in category independent object proposals.</p><p>Some might argue that if the end task is to detect a cer-tain set of categories (20 PASCAL or 80 COCO categories) then it is enough to evaluate on them and there is no need to care about other categories which are not annotated in the dataset. We agree, but it is important to keep in mind that object detection is not the only application of object proposals. There are other tasks for which it is important for proposal methods to generate category independent proposals. For example, in semi/unsupervised object localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> the goal is to identify all the objects in a given image that contains many object classes without any specific target classes. In this problem, there are no imagelevel annotations, an assumption of a single dominant class, or even a known number of object classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Thus, in such a setting, using a proposal method that has tuned itself to 20 PASCAL objects would not be ideal -in the worst case, we may not discover any new objects. As mentioned earlier, there are many such scenarios including learning object-object interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, content aware media retargeting <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, visual tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, etc.</p><p>To summarize, the contributions of this paper are:</p><p>• We report the 'gameability' of the current object proposal evaluation protocol. • We demonstrate this 'gameability' via a simple thought experiment where we propose a 'fraudulent' object proposal method that significantly outperforms all existing object proposal techniques on current metrics, but would under any no circumstances be considered a category independent proposal technique. As a side contribution of our work, we present a simple technique for producing state-of-art object proposals. • After establishing the problem, we propose three ways of improving the current evaluation protocol to measure the category independence of object proposals: 1. evaluation on fully annotated datasets, 2. cross-dataset evaluation on densely annotated datasets. 3. a new evaluation metric that quantifies the bias capacity of proposal generators. For the first test, we introduce a nearly-fully annotated PASCAL VOC 2010 where we annotated all instances of all object categories occurring in the images. • We thoroughly evaluate existing proposal methods on this nearly-fully and two densely annotated datasets. • We have released release all code and data for experiments 2 , and an object proposals library that allows for comparison of popular object proposal techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Types of Object Proposals: Object proposals can be broadly categorized into two categories:</p><p>• Window scoring: In these methods, the space of all possible windows in an image is sampled to get a subset of the windows (e.g., via sliding window). These windows are then scored for the presence of an object based on the image features from the windows. The algorithms that fall under this category are <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. • Segment based: These algorithms involve oversegmenting an image and merging the segments using some strategy. These methods include <ref type="bibr">[2, 3, 6-9, 11, 44, 46, 49]</ref>. The generated region proposals can be converted to bounding boxes if needed.</p><p>Beyond RGB proposals: Beyond the ones listed above, a wide variety of algorithms fall under the umbrella of 'object proposals'. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> used spatio-temporal object proposals for action recognition, segmentation and tracking in videos. Another direction of work <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> explores use of RGB-D cuboid proposals in an object detection and semantic segmentation in RGB-D images. While the scope of this paper is limited to proposals in RGB images, the central thesis of the paper (i.e., gameability of the evaluation protocol) is broadly applicable to other settings.</p><p>Evaluating Proposals: There has been a relatively limited analysis and evaluation of proposal methods or the proposal evaluation protocol. Hosang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> focus on evaluation of object proposal algorithms, in particular the stability of such algorithms on parameter changes and image perturbations. Their works shows that a large number of category independent proposal algorithms indeed generalize well to non-PASCAL categories, for instance in the ImageNet 200 category detection dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Although these findings are important (and consistent with our experiments), they are unrelated to the 'gameability' of the evaluation protocol. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, authors present an analysis of various proposal methods regarding proposal repeatability, ground truth annotation recall, and their impact on detection performance. They also introduced a new evaluation metric (Average Recall). Their argument for a new metric is the need for a better localization between generated proposals and ground truth. While this is a valid and significant concern, it is orthogonal to the'gameability' of the evaluation protocol, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously addressed. Another recent related work is <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, which analyzes various methods in segment-based object proposals, focusing on the challenges faced when going from PASCAL VOC to MS COCO. They also analyze how aligned the proposal methods are with the bias observed in MS COCO towards small objects and the center of the image and propose a method to boost their performance. Although there is a discussion about biases in datasets but it is unlike our theme, which is 'gameability' due to these biases. As stated earlier, while early papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> reported cross-dataset or cross-category generalization experiments similar to ones reported in this paper, with the trend of learning-based proposal methods, these experiments and concerns seem to have fallen out of standard practice, which we show is problematic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Evaluating Object Proposals</head><p>Before we describe our evaluation and analysis, let us first look at the object proposal evaluation protocol that is widely used today. The following two factors are involved:</p><p>1. Evaluation Metric: The metrics used for evaluating object proposals are all typically functions of intersection over union (IOU) (or Jaccard Index) between generated proposals and ground-truth annotations. For two boxes/regions b i and b j , IOU is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">IOU(b i , b j ) = area(b i ∩ b j ) area(b i ∪ b j )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The following metrics are commonly used:</p><p>• Recall @ IOU Threshold t: For each ground-truth instance, this metric checks whether the 'best' proposal from list L has IOU greater than a threshold t. If so, this ground truth instance is considered 'detected' or 'recalled'. Then average recall is measured over all the ground truth instances:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Recall @ t = 1 |G| gi∈G I [max lj ∈L IOU(g i , l j ) &gt; t],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where I[·] is an indicator function for the logical preposition in the argument. Object proposals are evaluated using this metric in two ways: This metric eliminates the need for a threshold. We first calculate the overlap between each ground truth annotation g i ∈ G, and the 'best' object hypotheses in L. ABO is calculated as the average:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ABO = 1 |G| gi∈G max lj ∈L IOU(g i , l j )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>ABO is typically is calculated on a per class basis. Mean Average Best Overlap (MABO) is defined as the mean ABO over all classes.</p><p>• Average Recall (AR): This metric was recently introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Here, average recall (for IOU between 0.5 to 1)-vs.-#proposals in L is plotted. AR also summarizes proposal performance across different values of t. AR was shown to correlate with ultimate detection performance better than other metrics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Dataset:</head><p>The most commonly used datasets are the PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> detection datasets. Note that these are partially annotated datasets where only the 20 PASCAL category instances are annotated. Recently analyses have been shown on ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, which has more categories annotated than PASCAL, but is still a partially annotated dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">A Thought Experiment: How to Game the Evaluation Protocol</head><p>Let us conduct a thought experiment to demonstrate that the object proposal evaluation protocol can be 'gamed'.</p><p>Imagine yourself reviewing a paper claiming to introduce a new object proposal method -called DMP.</p><p>Before we divulge the details of DMP, consider the performance of DMP shown in <ref type="figure">Fig</ref> As we can clearly see, the proposed method DMP significantly exceeds all existing proposal methods <ref type="bibr">[1-6, 8, 10, 11]</ref> (which seem to have little variation over one another). The improvement at some points in the curve (e.g., at M=10) seems to be an order of magnitude larger than all previous incremental improvements reported in the literature! In addition to the gain in AUC at a fixed M, DMPs also achieves the same AUC (0.55) at an order of magnitude fewer number of proposals (M=10 vs. M= 50 for edgeBoxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>). Thus, fewer proposals need to be processed by the ensuing detection system, resulting in an equivalent run-time speedup. This seems to indicate that a significant progress has been made in the field of generating object proposals.</p><p>So what is our proposed state-of-art technique DMP? It is a mixture-of-experts model, consisting of 20 experts, where each expert is a deep feature (fc7)-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> objectness detector. At this point, you, the savvy reader, are probably already beginning to guess what we did.</p><p>DMP stands for 'Detector Masquerading as Proposal generator'. We trained object detectors for the 20 PASCAL categories (in this case with RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>), and then used these 20 detectors to produce the top-M most confident detections (after NMS), and declared them to be 'object proposals'.</p><p>The point of this experiment is to demonstrate the following fact -clearly, no one would consider a collection of 20 object detectors to be a category independent object proposal method. However, our existing evaluation protocol declared the union of these top-M detections to be state-of-the-art.</p><p>Why did this happen? Because the protocol today involves evaluating a proposal generator on a partially annotated dataset such as PASCAL. The protocol does not reward recall of non-PASCAL categories; in fact, early recall (near the top of the list of candidates) of non-PASCAL objects results in a penalty for the proposal generator! As a result, a proposal generator that tunes itself to these 20 PASCAL categories (either explicitly via training or implicitly via design choices or hyper-parameters) will be declared a better proposal generator when it may not be (as illustrated by DMP). Notice that as learning-based object proposal methods improve on this metric, "in the limit" the best object proposal technique is a detector for the annotated categories, similar to our DMP. Thus, we should be cautious of methods proposing incremental improvements on this protocol -improvements on this protocol do not necessarily lead to a better category independent object proposal method. This thought experiment exposes the inability of the existing protocol to evaluate category independence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Evaluation on Fully and Densely Annotated Datasets</head><p>As described in the previous section, the problem of 'gameability' is occurring due to the evaluation of proposal methods on partially annotated datasets. An intuitive solution would be evaluating on a fully annotated dataset. In the next two subsections, we evaluate the performance of 7 popular object proposal methods [1, 3-6, 8, 10] and two DMPs (RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and DPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>) on one nearly-fully and two densely annotated datasets containing many more object categories. This is to quantify how much the performance of our 'fraudulent' proposal generators (DMPs) drops once the bias towards the 20 PASCAL categories is diminished (or completely removed). We begin by creating a nearly-fully annotated dataset by building on the effort of PASCAL Context <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> and evaluate on this nearly-fully annotated modified instance level PASCAL Context; followed by cross-dataset evaluation on other partial-but-densely annotated datasets MS COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and NYU-Depth V2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>Experimental Setup: On MS COCO and PASCAL Context datasets we conducted experiments as follows:</p><p>• Use the existing evaluation protocol for evaluation, i.e., evaluate only on the 20 PASCAL categories. • Evaluate on all the annotated classes.</p><p>• For the sake of completeness, we also report results on all the classes except the PASCAL 20 classes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Training of DMPs: The two DMPs we use are based on two popular object detectors -DPM <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> and RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. We train DPM on 20 PASCAL categories and use it as an object proposal method. To generate large number of proposals, we chose a low value of threshold in Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Proposals are generated for each category and a score is assigned to them by the corresponding DPM for that category. These proposals are then mergesorted on the basis of this score. Object Proposals Library 2 : To ease the process of carrying out the experiments, we created an open source, easyto-use object proposals library. This can be used to seamlessly generate object proposals using all the existing algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> (for which the Matlab code has been released by the respective authors) and evaluate these proposals on any dataset using the commonly used metrics.    Creating Instance-Level Annotations for PASCAL Context 2 : Thus, we created instance-level bounding box annotations for all images in PASCAL Context dataset. First, out of the 459 category labels in PASCAL Context, we identified 396 categories to be 'things', and ignored the remaining 'stuff' or 'ambiguous' categories 5 -neither of these lend themselves to bounding-box-based object detection. See supplement 6 for details. We selected the 60 most frequent non-PASCAL categories from this list of 'things' and manually annotated all their instances. Selecting only top 60 categories is a reasonable choice because the average per category frequency in the dataset for all the other categories (even after including background/ambiguous categories) was roughly one third as that of the chosen 60 categories <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4a)</ref>. Moreover, the percentage of pixels in an image left unannotated (as 'background') drops from 58% in original PASCAL to 50% in our nearly-fully annotated PASCAL Context. This manual annotation was performed with the aid of the semantic segmentation maps present in the PASCAL Context annotations. Examples annotations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4d</ref>. For detailed statistics, see supplement <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Fully Annotated Dataset</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Observations:</head><p>We now explore how changes in the dataset and annotated categories affect the results of the thought experiment from Section 4. Figs. 5a, 5b, 5c, 5h compare the performance of DMPs with a number of existing proposal methods <ref type="bibr">[1-6, 8, 10, 11]</ref> on PASCAL Context.</p><p>We can see in Column (a) that when evaluated on only 20 PASCAL categories DMPs trained on these categories appear to significantly outperform all proposal generators. However, we can see that they are not category independent because they suffer a big drop in performance when evaluated on 60 non-PASCAL categories in Column (b). Notice that on PASCAL context, all proposal generators suffer a drop in performance between the 20 PASCAL categories and 60 non-PASCAL categories. We hypothesize that this due to the fact that the non-PASCAL categories tend to be generally smaller than the PASCAL categories (which were the main targets of the dataset curators) and hence difficult to detect. But this could also be due to the reason that authors of these methods made certain choices while designing these approaches which catered better to the 20 annotated categories. However, the key observation here (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5h</ref>) is that DMPs suffer the biggest drop. This drop is much greater than all the other approaches. It is interesting to note that due to the ratio of instances of 20 PASCAL categories vs other 60 categories, DMPs continue to slightly outperform proposal generators when evaluated on all categories, as shown in Column (c).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Densely Annotated Datasets</head><p>Besides being expensive, "full" annotation of images is somewhat ill-defined due to the hierarchical nature of object semantics (e.g. are object-parts such as bicycle-wheel, windows in a building, eyes in a face, etc. also objects?). One way to side-step this issue is to use datasets with dense annotations (albeit at the same granularity) and conduct cross-dataset evaluation.</p><p>MS COCO: Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> contains 91 common object classes (82 of them having more than 5,000 labeled instances). It not only has significantly higher number of instances per class than PASCAL, but also more object instances per image (7.7) as compared to ImageNet (3.0) and PASCAL (2.3).</p><p>NYU-Depth V2: NYU-Depth V2 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> is comprised of video sequences from a variety of indoor scenes as recorded by both the RGB and Depth cameras. It features 1449 densely labeled pairs of aligned RGB and depth images with instance-level annotations. We used these 1449 densely annotated RGB images for evaluating object proposal algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to compare proposal methods on such a dataset.</p><p>Results and Observations: Figs. 5d, 5e, 5f, 5i show a plot similar to PASCAL Context on MS COCO. Again, DMPs outperform all other methods on PASCAL categories but fail to do so for the Non-PASCAL categories. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5g</ref> shows results for NYU-Depth V2. See that when many classes in the test dataset are not PASCAL classes, DMPs tend to perform poorly, although it is interesting that the performance is still not as poor as the worst proposal generators. Results on other evaluation criteria are in the supplement 6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Bias Inspection</head><p>So far, we have discussed two ways of detecting 'gameability' -evaluation on nearly-fully annotated dataset and cross-dataset evaluation on densely annotated datasets. Although these methods are fairly useful for bias detection, they have certain limitations. Datasets can be unbalanced. Some categories can be more frequent than others while others can be hard to detect (due to choices made in dataset collection). These issues need to be resolved for perfectly unbiased evaluation. However, generating unbiased datasets is an expensive and time-consuming process. Hence, to detect the bias without getting unbiased datasets, we need a method which can measure performance of proposal methods in a way that category specific biases can be accounted for and the extent or the capacity of this bias can be measured. We introduce such a method in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Assessing Bias Capacity</head><p>Many proposal methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> rely on explicit training to learn an "objectness" model, similar to DMPs. Depending upon which, how many categories they are trained on, these methods could have a biased view of "objectness". One way of measuring the bias capacity in a proposal method to plot the performance vs. the number of 'seen' categories while evaluating on some held-out set. A method that involves little or no training will be a flat curve on this plot. Biased methods such as DMPs will get better and better as more categories are seen in training. Thus, this analysis can help us find biased or 'gamebility-prone'  <ref type="table">RCNN1  RCNN5  RCNN10  RCNN20  RCNN40  RCNN60  objectness1  objectness5  objectness10  objectness20  objectness40  objectness60  selectiveSearch</ref>  . Once trained, these methods were evaluated on a randomly-chosen set of~500 images, which had annotations for all 60 categories. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6a</ref> shows Area under Recall vs. #proposals curve for learning-based methods trained on different sets of categories. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6b</ref> and <ref type="figure">Fig. 6c</ref> show the variation of AUC vs. # seen categories and improvement due to increase in training categories (from 10 to 60) vs. #proposals respectively, for RCNN and objectness when trained on different sets of categories. The key observation to make here is that with even a modest increase in 'seen' categories with the same amount of increased training data, performance improvement of RCNN is significantly more than objectness. Selective Search <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and edgeBoxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> are the dashed straight lines since there is no training involved.</p><p>These results clearly indicate that as RCNN sees more categories, its performance improves. One might argue that the reason might be that the method is learning more 'objectness' as it is seeing more data. However, as discussed above, the increase in the dataset size is marginal (~40 images per category) and hence it unlikely that such a significant improvement is observed due to that. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that this improvement is because the method is learning class specific features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The seen categories are picked in the order they are listed in MS COCO dataset (i.e., no specific criterion was used).</p><p>Thus, this approach can be used to reason about 'gameability-prone' and 'gameability-immune' proposal methods without creating an expensive fully annotated dataset. We believe this simple but effective diagnostic experiment would help to detect and thus contribute in managing the category specific bias in all learning-based methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>To conclude, the main message of this paper is simply this -the current evaluation protocol for object proposal algorithms is not suitable if we view them as category independent object proposal methods (meant to discover <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, instances of all categories). By evaluating the 'recall' of instances on a partially annotated dataset, we fail to capture the performance of the proposal algorithm on all the remaining object categories that are present in the test set, but not annotated in the ground truth. We demonstrate this 'gameability' via a simple thought experiment where we propose a 'fraudulent' object proposal method that outperforms all existing object proposal techniques on current metrics. We introduce a nearly-fully annotated version of PASCAL VOC 2010 where we annotated all instances of 60 object categories other than 20 PASCAL categories occurring in all images. We perform an exhaustive evaluation of object proposal methods on our introduced modified instance level PASCAL dataset and perform cross-dataset generalization experiments on MS COCO and NYU-Depth V2. We have also released an easy-to-use library to evaluate and compare various proposal methods which we think will also be useful. Furthermore, since densely annotating the dataset is a tedious and costly task, we proposed a diagnostic experiment to detect and quantify the bias capacity in object proposal methods. As modern proposal methods become more learning-based and trained in an end-to-end fashion, it is clear that the distinction between detectors and proposal generators is becoming blurred. With that in mind, it is important to recognize and safeguard against the flaws in the protocol, lest we over-fit as a community to a specific set of object classes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>(a) shows PASCAL annotations natively present in the dataset in green.

For every test image, we generate the Selective Search proposals using the 'FAST' mode and calculate the 20 SVM scores for each proposal. The 'objectness' score of a proposal is then the maximum of the 20 SVM scores.

Another (stronger) DMP is RCNN which is a detection 
pipeline that uses 20 SVMs (each for one PASCAL cate-
gory) trained on deep features (fc7) [61] extracted on selec-
tive search boxes. Since RCNN itself uses selective search 
proposals, it should be viewed as a trained reranker of se-
lective search boxes. As a consequence, it ultimately equals 
selective search performance once the number of candidates 
becomes large. </table></figure>
