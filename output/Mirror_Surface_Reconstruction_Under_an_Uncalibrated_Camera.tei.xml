<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper addresses the problem of mirror surface reconstruction, and a solution based on observing the reflections of a moving reference plane on the mirror surface is proposed. Unlike previous approaches which require tedious work to calibrate the camera, our method can recover both the camera intrinsics and extrinsics together with the mirror surface from reflections of the reference plane under at least three unknown distinct poses. Our previous work has demonstrated that 3D poses of the reference plane can be registered in a common coordinate system using reflection correspondences established across images. This leads to a bunch of registered 3D lines formed from the reflection correspondences. Given these lines, we first derive an analytical solution to recover the camera projection matrix through estimating the line projection matrix. We then optimize the camera projection matrix by minimizing reprojection errors computed based on a cross-ratio formulation. The mirror surface is finally reconstructed based on the optimized cross-ratio constraint. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our method.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>3D reconstruction of diffuse surfaces has enjoyed tremendous success. Diffuse surfaces reflect light from a single incident ray to many rays in all directions, resulting in a constant appearance regardless of the observer's viewpoint. Methods for diffuse surface reconstruction can therefore rely on the appearance of the object. This paper considers mirror surfaces, which exhibit specular reflections and whose appearances are a reflection of the surrounding environment. Under specular reflection, an <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: (a) A stationary uncalibrated camera observing the reflections of a reference plane undergoing an unknown motion. (b) Surface points can be recovered using the crossratio between a surface point M and its reflection correspondences {X 0 , X 1 , X 2 }.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M X 0 X 1 X 2 m x 0 x 1 x 2 (a) (b)</formula><p>incoming ray is reflected to a single outgoing ray. This special characteristic leads to different appearances of the mirror surface under different viewpoints, and renders diffuse surface reconstruction methods useless. Meanwhile, there exist many objects with a mirror surface in the man-made environment. The study of mirror surface reconstruction is therefore an important problem in computer vision.</p><p>In this paper, we assume the mirror surface reflect a light ray only once, and tackle the mirror surface reconstruction problem by adopting a common approach of introducing motion to the environment. Unlike previous methods which require a fully calibrated camera and known motion, we propose a novel solution based on observing the reflections of a reference plane undergoing an unknown motion with a stationary uncalibrated camera (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(a)</ref>).</p><p>2D correspondences between the image and the reference plane are established by displaying a sweeping line on the plane (we use a computer screen as the reference plane in practice). The relative poses of the reference plane are then estimated <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and rays piercing the plane under different poses are determined for each image point on the mirror surface.</p><p>Given the rays and their corresponding image points, we first derive an analytical solution to estimate the camera projection matrix through estimating the line projection matrix. Such a line projection matrix can then be transformed to a corresponding camera (point) projection matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. To make our solution more robust to noise, we use this closedform solution as an initialization and optimize the camera projection matrix by minimizing reprojection errors computed based on a cross-ratio formulation for the mirror surface (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1(b)</ref>). The mirror surface is finally reconstructed based on the optimized cross-ratio constraint.</p><p>The key contributions of this work are</p><p>• To the best of our knowledge, the first mirror surface reconstruction solution under an unknown motion and an uncalibrated camera.</p><p>• A closed-form (linear) solution for estimating the camera projection matrix from reflection correspondences.</p><p>• A cross-ratio based nonlinear formulation that allows a robust estimation of the camera projection matrix together with the mirror surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>Great efforts have been devoted to the problem of mirror surface recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Based on the assumed prior knowledge, shape recovery methods for mirror surfaces can be classified into those assuming an unknown distant environment and those assuming a known nearby environment.</p><p>Under an unknown distant environment, a set of methods referred to as shape from specular flow (SFSF) have been proposed. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Oren and Nayar successfully recovered a 3D curve on the object surface by tracking the trajectory of the reflection of a light source on the mirror surface. However, it is difficult to track a complete trajectory since the reflected feature will be greatly distorted near the occluding boundary of an object. Roth and Black <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> introduced the concept of specular flow and derived its relation with the 3D shape of a mirror surface. Although they only recovered a surface with a parametric representation (e.g., sphere), their work provides a theoretical basis for the later methods. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, Adato et al. showed that under far-field illumination and large object-environment distance, the observed specular flow can be related to surface shape through a pair of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Vasilyev et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> further suggested that it is possible to reconstruct a smooth surface from one specular flow by inducing integrability constraints on the surface normal field. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Canas et al. reparameterized the nonlinear PDEs as linear equations that lead to a more manageable solution.</p><p>Although SFSF achieves a theoretical breakthrough in shape recovery of mirror surfaces, the essential issues in tracking dense specular flow and in solving PDEs still hinder their practical use. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Sankaranarayanan et al.</ref> developed an approach that uses sparse specular reflection correspondences instead of specular flow to recover a mirror surface linearly. Their proposed method is more practical than the traditional SFSF methods. Nevertheless, their method requires quite a number of specular reflection correspondences across different views, which are difficult to obtain due to the distorted reflections on the mirror surface.</p><p>Under a known nearby environment, a different set of methods for shape recovery of mirror surfaces can be derived. The majority of these methods are based on the smoothness assumption on the mirror surface. Under this assumption, one popular way is to formulate the surfaces into the problem of solving PDEs. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Savarese and</ref> Perona demonstrated that local surface geometry of a mirror surface can be determined by analyzing the local differential properties of the reflections of two calibrated lines. Following the same fashion, Rozenfeld et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> explored the 1D homography relationship between the calibrated lines and the reflections using sparse correspondences. Depth and first order local shape are estimated by minimizing a statistically correct measure, and a dense 3D surface is then constructed by performing a constrained interpolation. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, Liu et al. proved that a smooth mirror surface can be determined up to a two-fold ambiguity from just one reflection view of a calibrated reference plane.</p><p>Another way to formulate the mirror surfaces is by employing normal consistency property to refine visual hull and/or integrate normal field. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Bonfort and Sturm introduced a voxel carving method to reconstruct a mirror surface using a normal consistency criterion derived from the reflections of some calibrated reference planes. In order to get a better view for shape recovery, they further proposed that the camera may not need to face the reference plane, and the shape can be well recovered by using a mirror to calibrate the poses of the reference plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Nehab et al. formulated the shape recovery as an image matching problem by minimizing a cost function based on normal consistency. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, Weinmann et at. employed a turntable setup with multiple cameras and displays, which enables the calculation of the normal field for each reflection view. The 3D surface is then estimated by a robust multi-view normal field integration technique. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Balzer et al. deployed a room-sized cube consisting of six walls that encode/decode specular correspondences based on a phase shift method. The surface is then recovered by integration of normal fields.</p><p>Besides, instead of directly formulating the surfaces, another direction is to reconstruct the individual light paths based on the law of reflection. Kutulakos and Steger <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> showed that a point on a mirror surface can be recovered if the positions of two reference points are known in space and reflected to the same image point in a single view, or the positions of two reference points are known and are re-flected by the same surface point to two different views. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Liu et al. established reflection correspondences on the reference plane under three distinct poses, and derived a method for recovering the relative poses of the plane. Given the camera intrinsics, the camera pose can also be solved and the surface can be recovered by ray triangulation.</p><p>Note that calibration plays an important role in all the above methods that assume a known nearby environment. In this paper, we neither make assumption on the smoothness of the mirror surface, nor require the calibration of the camera. Our proposed approach can automatically calibrate the setup as well as reconstruct the mirror surface using the observed reflections of the reference plane.</p><p>Cross-ratio constraint has been used to estimate mirror position and camera pose for axial non-central catadioptric systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and produce more point correspondences in the context of 3D reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Our method also relies on a cross-ratio constraint to optimize the camera projection matrix as well as recovering the mirror surface. Unlike existing methods handling the case when both the mirror and the reference plane are simultaneously visible to the camera (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>), we tackle a more challenging scenario where only the mirror surface is visible.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the setup used for mirror surface reconstruction. Consider a pinhole camera centered at C observing the reflections of a moving reference plane on a mirror surface S. Let X 0 be a point on the plane at its initial pose, denoted by P 0 , which is reflected by a point M on S to a point m on the image plane I. Suppose the reference plane undergoes an unknown rigid body motion, and let P 1 and P 2 denote the plane at its two new poses. Let X 1 and X 2 be points on P 1 and P 2 , respectively, which are both reflected by M on S to the same image point m on I. X 0 , X 1 and X 2 are referred to as reflection correspondences of the image point m.</p></div>

Since P ′ only depends on the elements of R and T, it can be converted to a point projection matrix in the form of λ[R T]. The magnitude of λ is determined by the orthogonality of R, and its sign is determined by the sign of t 3 . Hence, given the camera intrinsics, the camera extrinsics can be recovered using the reflection correspondences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> also provides another way for estimating R and T with given camera intrinsics. In Section 5, we tackle the problem of unknown camera intrinsics by formulating the problem into a nonlinear optimization by minimizing reprojection errors computed based on a cross-ratio formulation for the mirror surface. For initialization purpose, we assume (u 0 , v 0 ) being located at the image center, and f x = f y = f . We choose a rough range of f and for each sample value of f within the range, we estimate R and T by solving <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. The point to line distance criterion in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> is applied to find the best focal length f ′ .

In their original data, the bunny is placed in a cubic room, with each side of the room working as a reference plane. The reference pattern has a dimension of 3048×3048 mm 2 . The center of the room is defined as the world origin. A camera is placed in the room viewing the bunny. Since our method requires reflection correspondences under three distinct poses of a reference plane, we introduced two additional planes for each side of the room and obtained the reflection correspondences through ray tracing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Synthetic Data</head><p>To evaluate the performance of our method, we added Gaussian noise to the image points with standard deviations ranging from 0 to 3.0 pixels. We initialized the projection matrix using the method described in Section 4. The optimized projection matrix together with the 3D surface points were obtained by minimizing reprojection errors computed based on our cross-ratio formulation. Our cross-ratio based formulation can effectively improve the initialization results. An example is given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The error in the rotation matrix R is the angle of the rotation induced by R gt R T , where R gt denotes the ground truth rotation matrix. The error in the translation vector T is the angle (T deg ) between T and T gt , where T gt denotes the ground truth translation vector. In addition, we obtain T scale = T gt − T to estimate the error in T.</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">f u f v u 0 v 0 R[ • ] T deg [ • ]</formula><p>T scale L 1.18% 0.84% 1.08% 2.78% 0.63 0.89 1.76% EL 1.32% 1.32% 0.07% 0.10% 1.01 1.26 2.12% CR 0.14% 0.14% 0.18% 0.09% 0.06 0.07 0.16% <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Estimation error under noise lv σ = 2.0 [pixel] on bunny.

It can be seen that the reprojection errors are nearly identical to the noise level.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Real Data</head><p>We evaluated our method on a sauce boat and two spheres respectively (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig. 9</ref>). We captured images us- ing a Canon EOS 40D digital camera with a 24-70 mm lens. A 19 inch LCD monitor was used as a reference plane and was placed at three different positions. For each position, we captured an image sequence of a thin bright stripe sweeping across the screen in vertical direction and then in horizontal direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. For each direction, we examined the intensity value sequence for each image point, and established the reflection correspondence by identifying the image in which the intensity attained a peak value. To improve the accuracy, quadratic approximation was applied to   the intensity profile in the neighborhood of the peak value. After establishing reflection correspondences, we first estimated the relative poses of the reference plane using the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. We then formed 3D lines from the reflection correspondences on the reference plane under the two poses that are furthest apart (e.g., P 0 and P 2 in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). These 3D lines were used to obtain a preliminary solution of projection matrix using the method in Section 4. This was used to initialize the nonlinear optimization described in Section 5.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">f u [pixel] f v [pixel] u 0 [pixel] v 0 [pixel] R [ • ] T deg [ • ] T</formula><p>To evaluate our method, we calibrated the camera and reference plane poses using <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We used the calibration result to estimate the surface and treated it as the ground truth. This result was compared against the result obtained using uncalibrated camera but calibrated plane poses, and our result using uncalibrated camera and uncalibrated plane poses. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig. 10</ref> shows the reconstructed surfaces and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref> shows the numerical errors. We aligned each estimated surface with the ground truth by a rigid body transformation before computing the reconstruction error <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The RMS reconstruction errors are below 3 mm. f u and f v errors are below 2%. u 0 , v 0 and T scale errors are below 10%. The angular errors are below 10 • for R and below 3 • for T. The errors in intrinsics and extrinsics are larger than those in the synthetic experiments. This is reasonable since accurate specular correspondences in real case are difficult to obtain due to the large and complex distortion caused by the mirror surface and varying lighting condition. The qualitative and quantitative results suggest the accuracy of our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Discussions and Conclusions</head><p>A novel method is introduced for mirror surface reconstruction. Our method works under an uncalibrated setup and can recover the camera intrinsics and extrinsics, along with the surface. We first proposed an analytical solution for camera projection matrix estimation, and then derived a cross-ratio based formulation to achieve a robust estimation. Our cross-ratio based formulation does not encounter degeneracy. However, degenerate cases (e.g., a planar mirror, a spherical mirror, etc) may occur to the system due to the application of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> to estimate relative poses of the reference plane. Employing methods without degeneracy to estimate the relative poses will help handle these cases.</p><p>The proposed method only needs reflection correspondences as input and removes the restrictive assumptions of known motions, C n continuity of the surface, and calibrated camera that are being used by other existing methods. This greatly simplifies the challenging problem of mirror surface recovery. We believe our work can provide a meaningful insight towards solving this problem. In the future, we would like to extend the proposed method to recover complete surfaces and investigate inter-reflection cases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Setup used for mirror surface reconstruction.
