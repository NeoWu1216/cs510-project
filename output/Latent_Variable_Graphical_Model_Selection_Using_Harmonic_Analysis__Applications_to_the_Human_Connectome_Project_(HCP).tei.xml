<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A major goal of imaging studies such as the (ongoing) Human Connectome Project (HCP) is to characterize the structural network map of the human brain and identify its associations with covariates such as genotype, risk factors, and so on that correspond to an individual. But the set of image derived measures and the set of covariates are both large, so we must first estimate a 'parsimonious' set of relations between the measurements. For instance, a Gaussian graphical model will show conditional independences between the random variables, which can then be used to setup specific downstream analyses. But most such data involve a large list of 'latent' variables that remain unobserved, yet affect the 'observed' variables sustantially. Accounting for such latent variables is not directly addressed by standard precision matrix estimation, and is tackled via highly specialized optimization methods. This paper offers a unique harmonic analysis view of this problem. By casting the estimation of the precision matrix in terms of a composition of low-frequency latent variables and high-frequency sparse terms, we show how the problem can be formulated using a new wavelet-type expansion in non-Euclidean spaces. Our formulation poses the estimation problem in the frequency space and shows how it can be solved by a simple sub-gradient scheme. We provide a set of scientific results on ∼500 scans from the recently released HCP data where our algorithm recovers highly interpretable and sparse conditional dependencies between brain connectivity pathways and well-known covariates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Consider a large scale neuroimaging study, e.g., the ongoing Human Connectome Project (HCP), where diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images (diffusion MRI) are acquired for a cohort of participants. Each subject provides a variety of clinical and cognitive measures in addition to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Won Hwa Kim and Hyunwoo J. Kim are joint first authors. the images, as well as demographic information such as age, gender, education status and so on. Such a rich data resource offers an unprecedented opportunity to answer many scientific questions. For instance, how do brain networks differ across gender, and does education or genotype have an association with structural brain connectivity beyond the expected effects of age? Until recently, the scientific community had limited means to answer such questions because public datasets were either small, not well curated or the imaging protocols used for acquisition were too heterogeneous. The recent public release of images (and covariates) from the HCP study makes such an analysis possible if we can address the associated modeling issues that arise in performing inference on such a high dimensional dataset.</p><p>A fundamental scientific goal in statistical analysis of HCP (and similar datasets) is to identify associations between the full set of variables and the entire spectrum of image-derived measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. For example, are a subset of the clinical covariates highly predictive of the inter-regional connectivity derived from the images? The traditional approach here may proceed by estimating a graphical model that best explains the data: where the nodes correspond to the full set of covariates (image-derived measures and clinical/cognitive scores) as jointly Gaussian random variables. By estimating the inverse of the covariance matrix between the variables, we precisely recover the graphical model structure. This may then be used to setup hypothesis driven structural equation models (SEM) or simple regression model based experiments. The difficulty is that in many modern image analysis problems, the total number of such covariates, say p, is far larger than the number of samples (subjects) n in the study. Classical model selection is highly problematic in this high dimensional setting since the empirical statistics are often poorly behaved. The popular solution here is to impose a sparsity regularization on the inverse of the covariance matrix Σ −1 . Using a ℓ 1 penalty on the entries of this matrix, under mild conditions, one can guarantee that the maximum likelihood solution will recover the true model <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. In the last five years, this idea has been extensively used in a broad spectrum of applications in computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> and medical imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>The formulation above, given its broad applicability, has been heavily studied and we now have a comprehensive treatment of efficient optimization routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> and regularization properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. These developments notwithstanding, there are various situations in medical image analysis, computational biology and other applications, which are not an ideal fit for the standard sparse inverse covariance matrix estimation model. For instance, in many real-world studies, there are a non-trivial number of latent variables that either cannot be directly observed or can only be measured at a high monetary cost or discomfort to the subject. The incorporation of such latent variables in the estimated structural relationship, generally called "latent variable graphical models", is not as extensively studied.</p><p>Related Work. There is some degree of consensus that a straightforward incorporation of such 'latent' variables in the default construction described above is problematic. Therefore, existing approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> must pre-specify the number of such variables in an ad-hoc manner and proceed with a bi-level non-convex scheme to estimate the parameters. There are other combinatorial heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> which cluster the observed variables and assign them incrementally to a latent variable. The practical effectiveness of such algorithms varies and they offer few theoretical guarantees. An interesting recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> resolves many of these problems and presents an algorithm where all variables (observed and latent) are jointly Gaussian. The main idea is to approximate the sample covariance matrix Σ in a way where the corresponding Σ −1 is expressed as a sum of a sparse matrix and a low-rank matrix. This recovers the influence of the unobserved latent variables as well as the conditional graphical model, as desired. This strategy works well as long as the low rank requirement remains valid; however, as the number of latent variables grow, the data will deviate farther from the low rank assumption. Consequently, the sparse term must explain a larger 'mass' of the data and the estimated matrix becomes denser.</p><p>Motivating this paper. The above discussion suggests that the means of regularizing the degrees of freedom (i.e., the low rank term) for the latent components may be less than ideal from a numerical perspective as the number of latent variables grow. This issue is, to our knowledge, does not have a simple 'fix'. To put this in perspective, notice that the literature suggests that high rank matrix completion (columns of the matrix belong to a union of multiple low-rank subspaces) uses a set of concepts that are quite different from those used for completing low-rank matrices (e.g., nuclear norm). So, a potential solution in our graphical model setting must also look for alternatives to the algebraic characterization (used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>). Certain classical tools at the high level, express a closely related intuition. Consider the following simple idea. If we think of the precision matrix as the composition of low and high frequency terms, the lower order terms may easily serve as a proxy for the latent components. Then, by asking that the remaining contribution should be sparse yields a similar overall effect as <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> but involves no spectral relaxations of the rank constraint. Harmonic analysis offers a natural tool for such needs via wavelets, which come with the full set of benefits of Fourier analysis but without the global bases -undesirable in this discrete setting. While wavelet expansions have traditionally been studied only for Euclidean spaces, recent results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> provide mechanisms for wavelet (and Fourier) transform of discrete (non-Euclidean) spaces such as graphs as well. This discussion suggests that the potential ingredients for formulating our graphical model estimation problem in a dual space are available and provide at least a good starting point for the current problem.</p><p>The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate how this latent graphical model estimation problem can be viewed via the lens of harmonic analysis. We show that by operating on the inverse covariance matrix via its associated graph (actually a wavelet transform of this graph), it becomes an inference problem casted in the frequency space. The actual optimization requires no sophisticated solvers, we only need to perform a simple gradient descent on one variable that controls the band-pass filtering property of wavelets. Our motivating application is the analysis of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset which includes more than ∼350 covariates (and therefore, many latent variables) together with a rich set of imaging data. Here, we obtain neuroscientifically meaningful sparse models relating image-derived brain connectivity to covariates where alternative approaches yield uninterpretable results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Multi-resolution Analysis of Euclidean/Non-Euclidean Spaces via Wavelets</head><p>Our proposed framework relies heavily on a novel multiresolution perspective of the given data. Specifically, our model will reformulate the statistical model estimation problem utilizing the theory of wavelets to understand the underlying structural associations in the given data. We therefore briefly provide an overview of the wavelet transform in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Continuous Wavelet Transform</head><p>The wavelet transform is similar to the Fourier transform in that a function is decomposed as a linear combination of coefficients and certain basis functions. While the Fourier expansion uses sin() bases with infinite support, the wavelet expansion instead uses a mother wavelet basis ψ which is nicely localized in both time and frequency.</p><p>A description of the classical wavelet transform must start by defining a mother wavelet ψ s,a with a scale parameter t and a translation parameter a as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ψs,a(x) = 1 s ψ( x − a s )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where s (and a) control the dilation (and localization) of ψ s,a respectively. Using ψ s,a as the bases, the wavelet transform of a function f (x) is defined as the inner product of the ψ and f , represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">W f (s, a) = f, ψ = 1 s f (x)ψ * ( x − a s )dx (2)</formula><p>where W f (s, a) is the wavelet coefficient at scale s and at location a, and ψ * is the complex conjugate of ψ. Together with the wavelet coefficients and the wavelet bases, we obtain a wavelet expansion. Observe the similarity of (2) to the Fourier expansion given aŝ</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f (ω) = f (x)e −jωx dx f,basis<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Interestingly, in the frequency domain, the mother wavelets ψ s at multiple scales behave as band-pass filters corresponding to different bandwidths. Since these bandpass filters do not cover the low-frequency components, an additional low-pass filter is typically introduced: a scaling function φ. We will shortly discuss the significant benefits of this low-pass property to express the latent components in our formulation. A wavelet transform with the scaling function φ returns a smooth representation of the original function f . Due to this selective filtering property, wavelets offer a nice multi-resolution view of the given signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Wavelet Transforms in Non-Euclidean Spaces</head><p>The implementation of a mother wavelet and wavelet transform in the Euclidean space (i.e., represented as a regular lattice) is convenient since one can easily define the 'shape' of a mother wavelet. This concept has been extensively used within computer vision and image processing for nearly three decades. However, in a non-Euclidean setting where the domain is irregular (e.g., a graph), the notions of scale and translation are not as easy to conceptualize. For instance, in a graph, the distance between each vertex and the number of connected edges is not uniform, it is difficult to define a localized mother wavelet function at a specific scale. Due to this difficulty, the wavelet transform has not been traditionally suitable for analysis when the domain has an arbitrary structure until very recently when <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> presented a result dealing with wavelet and Fourier transform of graphs (and other non-Euclidean spaces).</p><p>High level summary. The key idea behind the non-Euclidean wavelet transform in constructing a mother wavelet ψ on the nodes of a graph G is to utilize a kernel function and a set of orthonormal bases. Recall that the wavelet behaves as a band-pass filter in the frequency domain. So, if we construct a band-pass filter (a kernel function) in the frequency domain and then localize it in the original (i.e., native) domain using graph Fourier transform in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, it will exactly implement a mother wavelet ψ on the original graph. The preferred representation of the graph is its Laplacian whose eigenvectors provide the 'bases' for transforming the graph to the frequency space.</p><p>Formally, a graph G = {V, E} is defined by a vertex set V (where the number of vertices is N ) and a edge set E. Such a graph G is generally represented as an adjacency matrix A of size N × N where the elements a ij denote the edge weight between ith and jth vertices. Then a degree matrix D is defined as a diagonal matrix where the ith diagonal is the sum of edge weights connected to the ith vertex. From these two graph matrices, a graph Laplacian is defined as L = D − A. Here, L is self-adjoint and positive semi-definite, therefore the spectrum of L yields eigenvalues λ l ≥ 0 and corresponding eigenvectors χ l where l = 0, 1, · · · N − 1. The orthonormal bases χ allow one to setup the graph Fourier transform aŝ</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f (l) = N n=1 χ * l (n)f (n) and f (n) = N −1 l=0f (l)χ l (n)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>wheref (l) is the graph Fourier coefficient. Interestingly, this transform offers a convenient means for transforming a signal/measurement on graph nodes/vertices to the frequency domain. Utilizing the graph Fourier transform, the mother wavelet ψ can be constructed by first defining a kernel function g(·) in the frequency domain and then localizing it by a delta function δ in the original graph via the inverse graph Fourier transform. Since δ n , χ l = χ * l (n), the mother wavelet ψ s,n at vertex n at scale s is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ψs,n(m) = N −1 l=0 g(sλ l )χ * (n)χ l (m).<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Notice that the scale s is defined inside g by the scaling property of Fourier transform <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and the eigenvalues serve as the analogs of frequency. Using ψ, the wavelet transform of a function f at scale s can be expressed simply as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">W f (s, n) = f, ψs,n = N −1 l=0 g(sλ l )f (l)χ l (n)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>resulting in wavelet coefficients W f (s, n). Such a transform offers a multi-resolution view of signals on graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The most important fact relevant to our formulation is that the multi-resolution property can be easily captured by a single parameter s in the kernel function g which controls the lowpass properties of the transform entirely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">A Harmonic Analysis of Latent Variable Graphical Models</head><p>With the aforementioned wavelet concepts in hand, we can now describe our formulation for estimating a precision matrix while concurrently taking into account the effect of an unknown but large number of latent components. Our procedure below will parameterize the to-beinferred graphical model not in terms of its precision matrix directly, rather via its low and high frequency components. Operating on these latent (low-frequency) and sparse (high-frequency) pieces will model the structural associations within the graph. Recall that recent developments in wavelet analysis on discrete spaces such as graphs have overwhelmingly been used to analyze signals defined on the nodes where the graph has a "fixed" (known) structure. In order to apply wavelet analysis to our problem, we will need to introduce a few key technical results that are summarized below, and described in detail in this section. (a) First, we will introduce multi-resolution analysis for modeling the graph structure and not just the measurement at individual graph nodes. We will define a new set of basis functions for estimating the graph structures and provide theoretical conditions which guarantee its validity. (b) Second, we will introduce an information theoretic "closeness" measure for graph structure (i.e., precision matrices). Here, we will identify an additional condition which will yield a valid symmetric positive definite matrix at each scale s. (c) Finally, we will discuss our optimization scheme in the dual space (i.e., frequency domain) with a simple gradient descent method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Multi-scale Analysis of a Precision Matrix</head><p>Let us assume we are given a positive definite covariance matrix Σ of size n × n. Now, Σ can be easily decomposed in terms of its eigenvector and eigenvalues as,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Σ = V ΛV T = n ℓ=1 λ ℓ V ℓ V T ℓ<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where the ℓth column vector of V is the ℓth eigenvector and the ℓth diagonal of Λ is the corresponding ℓth eigenvalue of Σ which are all positive. Then, the precision matrix Θ is given as the inverse of the covariance matrix as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Θ = n ℓ=1 1 λ ℓ V ℓ V T ℓ = n ℓ=1 σ ℓ V ℓ V T ℓ<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where σ = 1 λ and σ are positive since λ are positive. Notice that both Σ and Θ are positive definite and self-adjoint, so their eigenvectors can be used for defining a Fourier type of transform which is analogous to the graph Fourier transform as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. For multi-resolution analysis of the precision matrix Θ, we first define our basis functions as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">ψ ℓ,s (i, j) = g(sσ ℓ )V * ℓ (i)V ℓ (j), ∀ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , n}<label>(9)</label></formula><p>at scale s and along the ℓth basis. Since we deal only with real valued functions, to avoid notational clutter, we will omit the conjugate operation for the eigenfunctions, i.e., V * (i) = V (i). These basis functions are analogous to mother wavelets and yield a nice result which we will present shortly. Now, we can easily setup a transform of the precision matrix using our basis above. This yields waveletlike coefficients as WΘ,s(ℓ) = Θ, ψ ℓ,s</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">= n,n i,j n ℓ ′ =1 σ ℓ ′ V ℓ ′ (i)V ℓ ′ (j)g(sσ ℓ )V ℓ (i)V ℓ (j) = σ ℓ g(sσ ℓ ).<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Using W Θ,s (ℓ), the multi-resolution reconstruction with a non-constant weight ds/s is obtained bỹ</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Θ(i, j) = 1 Cg ∞ 0 1 s n ℓ=1 WΘ,s(ℓ)ψ ℓ,s (i, j)ds.<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Roughly speaking, this can be viewed as the weighted average of multi-resolution reconstruction over scale s. A natural question here is whether we can guarantee if the reconstruction in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> is identical to the original precision matrix Θ. To address this issue, we define the admissibility condition for the function defined on the structure (or edges) of the graph. A kernel g(x) is said to satisfy the admissibility condition if the following condition holds</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∞ 0 g 2 (x) x dx =: Cg &lt; ∞<label>(12)</label></formula><p>when the reconstruction is defined with a non-constant weight dx/x as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Lemma 1 below shows that using the bases we constructed in (9), if g(x) satisfies admissibility condition, the matrix reconstruction in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> is identical, namely,Θ(i, j) = Θ(i, j).</p><p>Lemma 1 If Θ ≻ 0, Θ = Θ T and kernel g satisfies the admissibility condition </p><p>The full proof of this lemma is available in the supplement. We can derive a stronger result showing that using the bases in (9), the admissibility condition holds for two parameter kernels as well, i.e., g(s, σ). This allows defining a kernel, if desired, that separately handles the influence of the eigen value σ and a scale parameter s. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lemma 2 If kernel g satisfies the admissibility condition</head><p>This two parameter kernel result can be used for functions defined on either nodes (commonly used in non-Euclidean Wavelets) or edges (graph structure). The proof is available in the supplement. The admissibility condition for the classical SGWT (one parameter kernel for the functions defined on nodes) is studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and consistent with our result. Based on this harmonic analysis of graphical models, we next describe our main estimation algorithm to recover the sparse precision matrix by explicitly taking into account the contribution of the latent components.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Estimating the Optimal Scale forΘ</head><p>In this subsection, we describe the optimization scheme to estimateΘ which satisfies two properties: i) it is consistent with the empirical Θ and ii) satisfies sparsity properties (in the sense of the multi-resolution characterization) The reconstruction of Θ at level s is given bỹ</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Θ = n ℓ=1 σ ℓ g 2 (sσ ℓ )V ℓ V T ℓ = n ℓ=1 K(s, σ ℓ )V ℓ V T ℓ<label>(17)</label></formula><p>where K(s, σ ℓ ) := σ ℓ g 2 (sσ ℓ ). To keep notations concise, we will often use K as shorthand in this subsection.

Then, one can easily check thatΘ is symmetric positive definite, i.e.,Θ ∈ SPD, exactly as desired. At a high level, we seek for aΘ which is similar to the empirical (potentially non-sparse) estimate, Θ. To do so, we need to define "closeness" between our estimateΘ and Θ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experimental Results</head><p>We demonstrate two sets of experiments, one on synthetic brain network data to validate our framework where the ground truth is available, and the other on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data. The first experiment evaluates precision matrix estimation results using our framework by comparing it to the estimations from other methods and the ground truth. In the second experiment, we analyze an exquisite recently released imaging dataset of ∼ 500 individuals from the Human Connectome Project. We obtain brain connectivity pathways by processing Diffusion Tensor Images (DTI) and analyze this connectivity data jointly with a rich set of covariates. Among the many inter-regional fiber bundles, we focus our analysis on 17 major connections and identify which of the covariates are statistically associated with these major pathways. In both experiments, the objective is to estimate true dependencies between the observed variables when the latent variables are unobserved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Statistical Dependency Estimation on Synthetic Brain Connectivity Data</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate results of precision matrix estimation using synthetic brain connectivity data. Consider a case where we observe a set of n p + n c random variables, i.e., a set of n p structural brain connections (i.e., pathways) and n c covariates. We add additional n h number of latent variables that are assumed to be unobserved but statistically influence the full set of observed variables. Then, the statistical model estimation task is to find the true conditional dependencies between the observed variables alone, i.e., properly taking into account the effect of latent factors. In other words, we want to identify which brain connections are statistically associated with the covariates as well as how these pathways are related to one another.</p><p>Design. We set n p = 50 and n c = 10, so the total number of observed variables n o = 60. We run multiple replicates, each for a different setting for the number of latent variables n h . The dependencies between the brain connections are arbitrarily chosen such that 5% of the elements in the true precision matrix (i.e., ground truth) are non-zeros. We set each covariate to be dependent on the brain connections in a pattern (i.e., first five connections depend on the first covariate, next five connections depend on the second covariate, etc.). These dependencies between observed variables are the ground truth and can be visual checked to see if we estimate the same pattern. The latent variables are then connected to all observed variables with random weights; this ensures that our measurements of the observed variables include an effect from all latent variables. This yields a precision matrix Θ of size n × n and its corresponding covariance matrix Σ. Synthetic data are sampled from a multi-variate normal distribution using Σ. We draw samples only from the observed variables to construct a sample covariance matrix Σ o , which serves as the input for estimatingΘ o .</p><p>Experimental results with n h = 5 and n h = 10 latent variables are shown in the left/right blocks of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref> respectively. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1 (top row)</ref> shows the estimated dependencies between the full set of connections (covariates are not shown in the top row). The small spheres represent the physical centers of each brain connection and the edges in blue/red denote correct/incorrect estimation of the conditional dependency. The bottom row shows the estimated Θ o including the covariates. In each block, the first column shows Σ −1 o as the estimated precision matrixΘ o (i.e., sample precision matrix). Here, both sample precision matrices are dense due to the effect from the latent variables, leading to a solution which is far from Θ o . In the second and third column in both blocks, we include results from graphical Lasso <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and the method from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. When n h = 5, the sparsity pattern in the estimated precision matrices for both baselines and our algorithm are quite similar to the ground truth (few red edges). In the second row, we see that the oblique patterns expressing the relationship between the connectivity and the covariates is also recovered. When the number of latent variables grows, the low rank assumption  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) that are statistically associated to non-imaging covariates.</p><p>in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> becomes weaker and the data deviates from the assumptions of graphical lasso (which assumes all variables are observed). For n h = 10, neither of the baselines are able to recover the conditional dependencies between the connections and covariates (oblique patterns in the precision matrix). On the other hand, the fourth columns (second row) shows that our algorithm recovers Θ o with a sparsity pattern that is highly consistent with the ground truth Θ o .</p><p>Limitations. These results suggest that our algorithm is effective in identifying the true precision matrix even when there are diffusive effects of unobserved variables. However, in situations where we have a large number of latent variables and each affects only a small number of observed variables (i.e., high-frequency effect), our algorithm may not be able to identify the correct associations. This situation is very challenging and we are not aware of any other methods that can model such data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Experiments on Human Connectome Data</head><p>Dataset. The HCP 2 project recently made available high-quality imaging and clinical data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>) for over 500 healthy adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We analyzed the high angular resolution diffusion MR imaging (dMRI) dataset, consisting of 489 images <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. We obtained DTI from the dMRI data via standard fitting procedures which were then spatially normalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Seventeen major white matter connectivity measures were obtained by registering (using ANTS) the publicly available IIT atlas <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> to the HCP template. The average fractional anisotropy (FA) in each pathway was a proxy for the connection strength. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> lists the seventeen connectivity pathways.</p><p>Non-imaging covariates. Besides the imaging data, HCP provides several categories of non-imaging covariates for the subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> covering factors such as cognitive function, demographic variables, education and so on. In our experiments, we chose 22 variables related to demographics, physical health, sleep, memory, cognitive flexibility and etc. These covariates span a wide range high-level human behavior and highly relevant physiological measurements and the full list is included in the supplement. Experiment 1) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 2-4</ref> summarize the results of our experiments on the HCP data. The matrix shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref> lists the full set of connections and covariates used in our analysis, along the axes. Our goal was to recover a sparse (and interpretable) precision matrix explaining the conditional dependencies among these variables. It is clear from the figure that our algorithm indeed finds a parsimonious set of statistical relations, among the non-imaging covariates, among the brain pathways as well as across these two groups of variables. As we can expect, several connectivity pathways seem to be involved in several different categories of behavioral measures. These many-to-many dependencies are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref> and the major pathways that show strong associations with non-imaging measures are displayed visually (overlaid on a standard brain template) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>. Note that similar to the simulation setup, in this case, results from the baseline algorithms were non-sparse and hence harder to interpret. Part of the reason is that none of the measurements were controlled for various (observed or unobserved) nuisance variables. One advantage of our algorithm is to precisely take into account the effect of such latent nuisance variables automatically.</p><p>Finally, since there is no 'ground truth' available for these results, we checked if our findings are corroborated by independent results in the literature. We found that many of the associations in Figs. 3-4 appear as standalone find-  ings in multiple papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. For example, the association between the cingulum bundle and processing speed was the focus of <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> identified a relation between longitudinal fasciculus and cognitive/verbal ability and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> demonstrated that forceps major and gender were related. Significant associations have also been found between integrity of the uncinate fasciculus and spatial working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This is not definitive evidence that we identify the real underlying precision matrix, but promising that most of the identified associations have precedence in the literature.</p><p>Experiment 2) A recent result last year <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> demonstrated structural connectome differences across gender suggesting that men and women are 'wired' differently.</p><p>Since the data used in our experiments provides connectivity information jointly with a full set of covariates, it offers an opportunity to ask a similar question as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> but instead analyze second order effects -that is, are associations of structural connectivity with cognitive/behavioral covariates different across genders on a large well characterized cohort? We used the aforementioned seventeen brain connection pathways, divided our dataset into male/female groups and estimated precision matrices for each group separately. Ideally, each precision matrix will automatically control for the latent factors that contribute to the connectivity measurement independent of gender, and comparisons between the two matrices will suggest how statistical associations between structural connections and cognitive scores vary between men and women. We found at least a few conditional associations that had large differences across the two groups. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Undirected graphical models are used to address a variety of needs in in computer vision and machine learning. While existing methods for estimating statistical conditional independence between a set of random variables are quite effective, this analysis becomes problematic when there are multiple latent (unobserved) variables that nontrivially affect our measurements of the observed variables. This situation is becoming more frequent in many modern medical image analysis and computer vision datasets, where the latent variables cannot be measured due to cost or privacy reasons. We propose a novel perspective on this sparse inverse covariance matrix estimation problem (which involves latent variables) using non-Euclidean wavelet analysis. The experimental results using synthetic brain network data demonstrates that our algorithm provides substantial improvement over other graphical model selection methods. We present an extensive set of results on the recently released HCP imaging data set showing statistical dependencies between brain connectivity pathways and cognitive/behavioral covariates. Our result are consistent with independent findings in the neuroscience literature.</p></div>
