<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We study Isometric Non-Rigid Shape-from-Motion (Iso-NRSfM): given multiple intrinsically calibrated monocular images, we want to reconstruct the time-varying 3D shape of an object undergoing isometric deformations. We show that Iso-NRSfM is solvable from the warps (the inter-image geometric transformations). We propose a new theoretical framework based on Riemmanian manifolds to represent the unknown 3D surfaces, as embeddings of the camera's retinal planes. This allows us to use the manifolds' metric tensor and Christoffel Symbol fields, which we prove are related across images by simple rules depending only on the warps. This forms a set of important theoretical results. Using the infinitesimal planarity formulation, it then allows us to derive a system of two quartics in two variables for each image pair. The sum-of-squares of these polynomials is independent of the number of images and can be solved globally, forming a well-posed problem for N ≥ 3 images, whose solution directly leads to the surface's normal field. The proposed method outperforms existing work in terms of accuracy and computation cost on synthetic and real datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>One of the main problems in 3D vision is to reconstruct an object's 3D shape from multiple views. This has been solved for the specific case of rigid objects from interimage visual motion, and is known as Shape-from-Motion (SfM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, SfM breaks down for non-rigid objects. Two ways to exploit visual motion for non-rigid object reconstruction have been proposed: Shape-from-Template (SfT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> and Non-Rigid Shape-from-Motion (NRSfM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. The latter is a direct extension of SfM to the non-rigid case. The former however, is not. Indeed, the inputs of SfT are a single image and the object's template, and its output is the object's deformed shape. The template is a very strong object-specific prior, as it includes a reference shape, a texture map and a deformation model. Most SfT methods use physics-based deformation models such as isometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. This is because isometry is a very good approximation to the deformation of many real objects. The inputs of NRSfM are multiple images and its output is the object's 3D shape for every image. In NRSfM, the rigidity constraint of SfM is replaced by constraints on the object's deformation model. NRSfM methods were proposed for a variety of deformation models: the low-rank shape basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the trajectory basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, isometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> and elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Existing methods suffer one or several limitations amongst solution ambiguities, low accuracy, ill-posedness, inability to handle missing data and high computation cost. NRSfM thus still exists as an open research problem.</p><p>We present a solution to NRSfM with the isometric deformation model, that we hereinafter denote Iso-NRSfM. We model Iso-NRSfM using concepts from Riemannian geometry. Our framework relates the 3D shape to the inter-image warps, which we simply call warps. These may be computed from keypoint correspondences in several ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, and we assume they are known. More specifically, we model the object's 3D shape for each image by a Riemmanian manifold and deformations as isometric mappings. We parameterize each manifold by embedding the corresponding retinal plane. This allows us to reason on advanced surface properties, namely the metric tensor and Christoffel Symbols, directly in retinal coordinates, and in relationship to the warps. We prove two new theorems showing that the metric tensor and Christoffel Symbols may be transferred between views using only the warp. For an infinitesimally planar surface, we obtain a system of two quartics in two variables that involves up to second order derivatives of the warps. This system holds at each point. Its solution gives an estimate of the metric tensor, and thus of the surface's normal, in all views. The shape is finally recovered by integrating the normal fields for each view.</p><p>The proposed method has the following features. 1) It has a linear complexity in the number of views and number of points. 2) It uses a well-posed point-wise solution from N ≥ 3 views, thus covering the minimum data case.</p><p>3) It naturally handles missing data created by occlusions. 4) It substantially outperforms existing methods in terms of complexity and accuracy, as we experimentally verified using synthetic and real datasets. Beyond the proposed method, we bring a completely new theoretical framework to NRSfM allowing one to exploit the surface's metric tensor and Christoffel Symbols in a simple and neat way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">State-of-the-Art</head><p>Existing NRSfM methods can be divided into three main categories: i) object-wise, ii) piece-wise and iii) point-wise methods. i) solves for the entire object's shape at once. This group includes methods that assume a low-dimensional space of deformed shapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. These methods have been extensively studied in the recent years with the low-rank prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and other constraints such as temporal smoothness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or point trajectory constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>They have demonstrated to be accurate for objects with a low number of deformation modes, such as a talking face and articulated objects. These methods suffer in the presence of missing data and may present ambiguities <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (for instance due to the orthographic camera assumption). i) also includes methods using physics-based models such as isometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, elastic deformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or particle-based interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> copes with missing data but involves costly non-convex optimization, which requires a very good initialization. Recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> proposed a sequential solution based on elasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and particle interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Both methods are promising but require rigid motion at the beginning of the sequence to reconstruct the object's shape using rigid SfM. Those methods are related to SfT.</p><p>Methods in ii) and iii) are sometimes also called local methods. In piece-wise methods one selects a simple model that approximates the shape of a small region of the surface. NRSfM is then solved for each region. This can be analytical for planes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and local rigid motions with both the orthographic <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> cameras. More complex models, such as the local quadratic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, require non-linear iterative optimization. After solving for each region's approximate shape, a second step is to stitch together all reconstructions, imposing some order of continuity in the surface. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> stitching is done using submodular optimization. For some other models stitching can be solved by Linear Least Squares (LLS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Piece-wise methods are very problematic due to the need for segmenting the image domain in regions from which the local models are computed. Region segmentation is costly and difficult to define optimally for general surfaces. This has a major impact in the efficiency and accuracy of these methods.</p><p>Point-wise methods replace local regions with infinitesimal regions, which allows one to describe NRSfM as a system of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) involving differential properties of the shape and derivatives of the warps <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> presents a point-wise solution for isometric NRSfM assuming that the surface is infinitesimally planar. It gives analytical solutions to compute the surface's twofold ambiguous normal at any point from a pair of views. The strategy given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is to average over the normals that are compatible across different pairs. This finds a single normal per point but requires in practice a large amount of image pairs to be accurate and may thus be very expensive. The global shape is then obtained by integration of the normal fields by means of LLS. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> reports better results with respect to other methods, we show that it fails in several other cases.</p><p>Point-wise methods form a promising solution for Iso-NRSfM. In principle, they allow one to overcome the complexity, missing data, and accuracy limitations of other methods. However, in practice, no theoretical framework and practical method were proposed which overcome these limitations. Our paper attempts to fill this gap by proposing a Riemannian framework coupled with infinitesimal planarity, leading to a method solving NRSfM accurately, using small globally solvable optimization problems, and in time complexity linear in the number of images and points.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">General Model</head><p>Our model of NRSfM is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1</ref>. We have N input images I 1 , . . . , I N that show the projection of different isometric deformations of the same surface. The registration between the pair of images I i and I j is known and denoted by the functions η ij and η ji , called warps. In practice, we compute them from keypoint correspondences using <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Abusing notation, we also use I i to denote an image's retinal plane, with I i ⊂ R 2 . Surfaces in 3D are ... ... assumed to be Riemannian manifolds. This allows us to define lengths, angles and tangent planes on the surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. We denote M i as the ith manifold, which can be seen as a two-dimensional subset embedded in 3D, M i ⊂ R 3 . We use the extrinsic definition of M i , where a function embeds a subset of the plane R 2 into R 3 . With embedding functions, one can easily compute manifold characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> such as metric tensors and Christoffel Symbols. However, these characteristics change according to the coordinate frame. We use the retinal plane I i as coordinate frame for M i and define φ i ∈ C ∞ (I i , R 3 ) as the image embedding for M i . We define ψ ij as the isometric mapping between manifolds M i and M j .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Image Embeddings</head><p>We use the perspective camera as projection model.

The image embeddings φ i with i = 1, . . . , N define the inverse of a perspective projection, as they map retinal coordinates to a 3D surface. They thus satisfy the following identity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x = (Π • φ i )(x) i = 1, . . . , N.<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Smooth functions that comply with (2) can be expressed with a depth map</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ρ i ∈ C ∞ (I i , R), where: φ i (x) = ρ i (x) x 1 ⊤ i = 1, . . . , N.<label>(3)</label></formula></div>

The indexes m and n reference to each component of the coordinate frame of φ i , that we denote with</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">x = x 1 x 2 ⊤ .

We remind that the summation in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_4">(4)</ref> is done over indices s and k. The inverse of the metric tensor is expressed with raised indexes g mn [φ i ]. Given the change of coordinates:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x = η(y), with y = y 1 y 2 ⊤ ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>the metric tensor of φ i • η is obtained as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">g st [φ i • η] = ∂x m ∂y s ∂x n ∂y t g mn [φ i ],<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(6)</ref> we omit that g mn [φ i ] is composed with η to simplify notation.</p><p>We introduce next a theorem regarding the relationship between the metric tensors in the different manifolds φ i with i = 1, . . . , N if the mappings ψ ij with {i, j} ∈ {1, . . . , N } 2 are isometric. This theorem is fundamental for the formulation of our method. Theorem 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Christoffel Symbols</head><p>The Christoffel Symbols (CS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> of the second kind are functional arrays that describe several properties of a Riemannian manifold, such as the curvature tensor, the geodesic equations of curves and the parallel transport of vectors in surfaces. We denote the CS of function φ i as</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Γ p mn [φ i ]. Sometimes it is useful to represent the CS of φ i as two 2 × 2 matrices Γ 1 mn [φ i ] and Γ 2 mn [φ i ],</formula><p>where 1 and 2 are bases of the coordinate frame of φ i .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Infinitesimal Planarity</head><p>In infinitesimal planarity one assumes that a surface is at each point approximately planar. This is fundamentally different from piece-wise planarity: in infinitesimal planarity, the surface is globally curved and represented infinitesimally by an infinite set of planes. In other words, each infinitesimal model agrees with the global surface at the point where infinitesimal planarity is used only at zeroth order. We use this approximation to find a point-wise solutions to Iso-NRSfM. We proceed by assuming that any M i for i ∈ {1 . . . , N } is a plane and deriving the differential properties of the image embedding φ i , the metric tensor and the CS. We use these differential properties at each point of M i . We give two theorems and a corollary about the special properties of M i with i ∈ {1, . . . , N }, assuming planarity: 1) Theorem 2 shows that the inverse depth in the embedding φ i is a linear function, 2) Corollary 2 states that pointwise both the metric tensor and the CS of M i are described with the same 3 parameters and 3) Theorem 3 shows that the image warps η ji must comply with the so-called 2D Schwarzian derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, that arise in the field of projective differential geometry.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">Theorem 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Algorithm</head><p>We describe our solution to NRSfM based on the theoretical results drawn from the previous sections. The inputs of our system is a set of N images of a deforming object and the outputs are the evaluated depths and normals of the deformable objects depicted in each of N images. We fix a reference image such as i = 1, and match point correspondences between the reference image and the rest of the images. From the matched correspondences, we evaluate η 1j warps using Schwarps <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and extract a grid of points on all images. For each point x in the grid we can write the polynomial system described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. For N images, we have 2N − 2 polynomials with only 2 variables k 1 and k 2 (the CS of the reference image). There are two main steps in our algorithm: 1) Find the CS of all images. We compute a sum-of-squares of the 2N − 2 polynomials obtained from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> and find k 1 and k 2 by minimising this sum-of-squares polynomial using <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. By using k 1 and k 2 , we can write the CS for the rest of the images using <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. 2) Evaluate depths and normals of the N deformable objects. Now that we have the CS for the grid points in all the images, the normals can be obtained by normalising the cross-product of the two columns of the jacobian defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> in terms of the CS. Then, we use the method described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to recover the surfaces by integrating the normal fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experimental Results</head><p>We report experiments with synthetic data and five sets of real data. We compared our method 1 with five other NRSfM methods Chhatkuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Varol <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, Taylor <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Vicente <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, Torresani <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, Gotardo <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (only for temporal sequences). The code for these methods was obtained from the authors' websites except Varol which we re-implemented. We measure the shape error (mean difference between computed and ground truth normals in degrees) and depth error (mean difference between computed and ground truth 3D coordinates) to quantify the results. Experiments with synthetic data. We simulated random scenes of a cylindrical surface deforming isometrically. The image size is 640p × 480p and the focal length is 400p. We tracked 400 points. We compared all methods by varying the number of views and noise in the images. The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 3</ref>. The results are obtained after averaging the errors over 50 trials (the default is 1p noise and 10 views). On varying number of views: Our method <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The code is available at https://github.com/shaifaliparashar. Chhatkuli also perform a good reconstruction on varying number of views. Taylor gives decent results with 8-10 views. Torresani needs a video sequence or views with wide-baseline viewpoints, 10 views are not enough for reconstruction especially when they are low-baseline viewpoints. It therefore did not do well. The proposed method has consistently lower error then all others. The standard deviation of the depth error (in mm, for 10 images) is 2.38, <ref type="bibr">22.96, 8.78, 6.70, 6.48, 6</ref>.36 for our method, Torresani, Chhatkuli, Varol, Taylor and Vicente respectively. This shows that that our method is also very consistent in terms of reconstruction. On varying noise: For the 10 images of the synthetic dataset, we observe that all methods change the error linearly when noise varying from 1-5 pixels is added. Vicente and Taylor show a good tolerance to noise, even though their performance is worse than other methods. Our method, Chhatkuli and Varol give higher errors with noise greater than 3 pixels. Our method gives the best performance in the 1-3 pixel noise which is what we expect in real images.</p><p>Experiments with real data. We conducted experiments with five datasets: the hulk and t-shirt datasets (10 different images of a paper and a cloth deformed isometrically; public dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>), the kinect paper dataset (a video sequence of 191 frames and 1500 points of a paper deformed isometrically; public dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>), the rug dataset (159 images of a rug deforming isometrically, captured using kinect, points obtained using <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) and the cat dataset (60 images of a  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Reconstruction error maps for the rug, cat and kinect paper datasets.

Each block represents the average depth error (in mm)shape error (in • ). summarised below. The rug, cat and kinect paper datasets are long sequences and the hulk and t-shirt are short datasets (10 images, 110 and 85 point correspondences only). We have designed two kinds of experiments: 1) Experiments where the long sequences are uniformly sampled and we compare our results with the rest of the methods (see figure 4). The results for the hulk and t-shirt datasets are averaged over 20 trials of randomly picking up images. 2) Experiments with entire sequences (see <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>). Since our method can easily handle a large number of images, it is important to show results on large sequences. A limitation of current NRSfM methods is that they cannot handle a large number of views. Also, several NRSfM methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref> reconstruct the reference image only and are computationally expensive to recover the other shapes. Torresani, Gotardo reconstruct the entire imageset in one execution and therefore, we compare our method with both of them on long sequences. The cat dataset is a relatively short sequence (60 images) therefore, we added the results of Vicente for this dataset on the entire sequence. Chhatkuli and Varol need to compute homographies between image pairs, therefore, they grow non-linearly with the number of views. For 60 images, the execution time goes up to 45 min for a single reconstruction. Therefore, we did not compare against them even on the cat sequence. Taylor breaks on the cat sequence, therefore we did not include it. One must also note that Vicente, Taylor and Torresani grow with the number of views and point correspondences, therefore, they are not very efficient with a large number of views. Rug, cat and kinect paper datasets. The length of the portion of the rug, table mat and paper tracked is 1m, 35cm and 30cm respectively. <ref type="figure">Figure 4(a-c)</ref> show that our method works best amongst the compared methods for these datasets. We perform consistently better than the other methods by a significant margin in these datasets. This is quite in accordance with the results obtained for the synthetic data. Varol, Chhatkuli also show good results on these datasets. Vicente has a comparable depth error but relatively higher shape error on these datsets. This indicates that the reconstruction is more or less placed at the right place but the object is flat. Taylor gives bad results on the rug and cat dataset but decent results on the kinect paper dataset because it is a good dataset for orthographic methods as there is not too much perspective in the deformations. Torresani gives bad results because 10 views are not enough.</p><p>However, when compared against our method on the entire sequences, Torresani gives better results because of the higher number of views (see <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>). Gotardo performs better than Torresani on all the sequences and gives decent results on the cat and rug dataset. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows the reconstruction error maps for the rug, cat and kinect paper dataset on some of the images used to compare all methods in figure 4. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> summarises the performance of the compared methods on the complete sequences.</p><p>Hulk and T-shirt datasets. The length of the portion of the paper and cloth tracked is 24cm and 20cm respectively. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>(d-e) shows that our performance is very close to Chhatkuli which is significantly better than other methods. Chhatkuli is particularly better than Varol on these datasets because it deals with wide-baseline data very effectively.

Current NRSfM methods do not deal with occlusions and missing data effectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>We proposed a theoretical framework for solving NRSfM locally for surfaces deforming isometrically using Riemannian geometry for manifolds for N ≥ 3 views. Unlike other methods, the proposed method has only two variables for N views. Therefore, it easily handles large numbers of views. The complexity is linear which is a substantial improvement over the current state-of-the-art methods. We tested our method on datasets with wide-baseline and short-baseline viewpoints, large and small deformations. Our results show that the proposed method consistently gives significantly better results than the state-of-theart methods even for as few as 3 views. For future work, we will explore the possibility of extending this framework to non-isometric deformations. Acknowledgements.
