<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Scene labeling refers to associating one of the semantic classes to each pixel in a scene image. It is usually defined as a multi-class classification problem based on their surrounding image patches. However, some classes may be in- * Equal contribution † Corresponding author distinguishable in a close-up view. As an example in <ref type="figure">Figure  1</ref>, the 'sand' and 'road' pixels are hard to be distinguished even for humans with limited context. In contrast, their differentiation becomes conspicuous when they are considered in the global scene. Thus, how to equip local features with a broader view of contextual awareness is a pivotal issue in image labeling. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>[18] are introduced to address this issue by modeling the contextual dependencies of local features. Specifically, we adopt undirected cyclic graphs (UCGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> to represent the connectivity of pixels in images. Due to the loopy property of UCGs, RNNs are not directly applicable to UCGstructured images. Thus, we decompose the UCG to several directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In other words, an UCGstructured image is represented by the combination of several DAG-structured images. Then, we develop the DAG-RNNs, a generalization of RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, to process DAGstructured images. Each hidden layer is generated independently through applying DAG-RNNs to the corresponding DAG-structured image, and they are aggregated to produce the context-aware feature maps. In this case, the local representations are able to embed the abstract gist of the image, so their discriminative power are enhanced remarkably.</p><p>We integrate the DAG-RNNs with the convolution and deconvolution layers, thus giving rise to an end-to-end trainable full labeling network. Functionally, the convolution layer transforms RGB raw pixels to compact and discriminative representations. Based on them, the proposed DAG-RNNs model the contextual dependencies of local features, and output the improved context-aware representation. The deconvolution layer upsamples the feature maps to match the dimensionality of the desired outputs. Overall, the full labeling network accepts variable-size images and generates the corresponding dense label prediction maps in a single feed-forward network pass. Furthermore, considering that the class frequency distribution is highly imbalanced in natural scene images, we propose a novel class weighting function that attends to rare classes.</p><p>We test the proposed labeling network on three popular and challenging scene labeling benchmarks (SiftFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, CamVid <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Barcelona <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>). On these datasets, we show that our DAG-RNNs are capable of greatly enhancing the discriminative power of local representations, which leads to dramatic performance improvements over baselines <ref type="bibr">(CNNs)</ref>. Meanwhile, the proposed class weighting function is able to boost the recognition accuracy for rare classes. Most importantly, our full labeling network significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>Next, related works are firstly reviewed, compared and discussed in Section 2. Section 3 elaborates the details of the DAG-RNNs and how they are applied to image labeling. Besides, it presents the details of the full labeling network and the class weighting function. The detailed experimental results and analysis are presented in Section 4. In the end, section 5 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Scene labeling (also termed as scene parsing, semantic segmentation) is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision. It has attracted more and more attention in recent years. Here we would like to highlight and discuss three lines of works that are most relevant to ours.</p><p>The first line of work is to explore the contextual modeling. One attempt is to encode context into local representation. For example, Farabet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> stacks surrounding contextual windows from different scales; Pinheiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> increases the size of input windows. Sharma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> adopts recursive neural networks to propagate global context to local regions. However, they do not consider any connectivity structure for image units, thus their correlations are not effectively captured. In contrast, we interpret the structure of images as UCGs, within which the connections of image units allow the DAG-RNNs to explicitly model the their dependencies. Another attempt is to pass context to local classifiers by building probabilistic graphical models (PGM). For example, Shotton et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> formulates the unary and pairwise features in a 2nd-order Conditional Random Field (CRF). Krähenbühl et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> build a fully connected graph to enforce higher order la-beling coherence. Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> transforms the efficient Conditional Random Fields (CRF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> to a neural network, so the inference of CRF equals to applying the same neural network recurrently until some fixed point (convergence) is reached. Shuai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> transfers the global-order dependencies in a non-parametric framework to disambiguate the local confusions. Our work also differs from them. First, the label dependencies are defined in terms of compatibility functions over cliques in PGMs, while such dependencies are modeled through a recurrent weight matrix in RNNs.</p><p>Some of the previous work exploit 'recurrent' ideas in a different way. They generally refer to applying the identical model recurrently at different iterations (layers). For example, Pinheiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> attachs the RGB raw data with the output of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to produce the input for the same CNN in the next layer. Tu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> augments the patch feature with the output of the classifier to be the input for the next iteration, and the classifier parameters are shared across different iterations. Our work differs from them significantly. They model the context in the form of intermediate outputs (usually local beliefs), which implicitly encodes the neighborhood information. In contrast, the contextual dependencies are modeled explicitly in DAG-RNNs by propagating information via the recurrent connections.</p><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved great success in temporal dependency modeling for chainstructured data, such as natural language and speeches. Zuo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> applies 1D-RNN to model weak contextual dependencies in image classification. Graves et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> generalizes 1D-RNN to multi-dimensional RNN (MDRNN) and applies it to offline arabic handwriting recognition. Shuai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> also adopts 2D-RNN to real-world image labeling. Recently, Tai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> demonstrate that considering tree structure (constituent / parsing trees for sentences) is beneficial for modeling the global representation of sentences. Our proposed DAG-RNN is a generalization of chain-RNNs [1] <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, tree-RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and 2D-RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and it enables the network to model long-range semantic dependencies for graphical structured images. The most relevant work to ours is <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Comparing with it, (1), we generalize 2D-RNN to DAG-RNN and show benefits in quantitative labeling performance; (2), we integrate the convolution layer, deconvolution layer with our DAG-RNNs to a full labeling network; and (3), we adopt a novel class weighting function to address the extremely imbalanced class distribution issue in natural scene images. Moreover, the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of scene labeling benchmarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Approach</head><p>To densely label an image I, our full labeling network process the image sequentially: (1), Convolution layer pro-duces the corresponding feature map x. Each feature vector in x summarizes the information from a local region in I. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, DAG-RNNs model the contextual dependency among elements in x, and generates the intermediate feature map h, whose element is a feature vector that implicitly embeds the abstract gist of the image. (3), Deconvolution layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> upsamples the feature maps. From which, the dense label prediction maps are derived. We start by introducing the proposed DAG-RNNs, and the details of the full network are elaborated in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">RNNs Revisited</head><p>A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network that has recurrent connections, which equip the network with memory. In this paper, we focus on the Elman-type network <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Specifically, the hidden layer h (t) in RNNs at time step t is expressed as a non-linear function over current input x (t) and hidden layer at previous time step h (t−1) . The output layer y (t) is connected to the hidden layer h (t) . Mathematically, given a sequence of inputs {x (t) } t=1:T , an Elman-type RNN operates by computing the following hidden and output sequences:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h (t) = f (U x (t) + W h (t−1) + b) y (t) = g(V h (t) + c)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where U, W are weight matrices between the input and hidden layers, and among the hidden units themselves, while V is the output matrix connecting the hidden and output layers; b, c are corresponding bias vectors and f (·),g(·) are element-wise nonlinear activation functions. The local information x (t) is progressively stored in the hidden layers by applying Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref>. In other words, the contextual information (the summarization of past sequence information) is explicitly encoded into local representation h (t) . Training a RNN can be achieved by optimizing a discriminative objective with a gradient-based method. Back Propagation through time (BPTT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> is usually used to calculate the gradients. This method is equivalent to unfolding the network in time and using back propagation in a very deep feed-forward network except that the weights across different time steps (layers) are shared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">DAG-RNNs</head><p>The aforementioned RNN is designed for chainstructured sequential data (e.g. sentences or speeches), where temporal dependency is modeled. However, the connectivity structure of image units are beyond chain. In other words, traditional chain-structured RNNs are not suitable for images. For instance, we can reshape the feature tensor x ∈ R h×w×d tox ∈ R (h·w)×d , and generate the chain representation by connecting contiguous elements inx. Such a structure loses spatial relationship of image units, as two adjacent units in image plane may not necessarily be neighbors in the chain. The graphical representations that respect the 2-D neighborhood system are more plausible solutions, and they are pervasively adopted in probabilistic graphical models (PGM). Therefore in this work, undirected cyclic graphs (UCG , an example is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>) are used to represent the connectivity structure of image units.</p><p>Due to the loopy structure of UCGs, they are unable to be unrolled to an acyclic processing sequence. Therefore, RNNs are not directly applicable to UCG-structured images. To address this issue, we approximate the topology of UCG by a combination of several directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), each of which is applicable for our proposed DAG-RNNs (one of the induced DAGs is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). Namely, an UCG-structured image is represented as the combination of a set of DAG-structured images. We now start introducing the detailed mechanism of our DAG-RNNs here, and later elaborate how they are applied to UCG-structured images in the next section.</p><p>We first assume that the topology of an image I is represented as a DAG G = {V, E}, where V = {v i } i=1:N is the vertex set and E = {e ij } is the arc set (e ij denotes an arc from v i to v j ). The structure of the hidden layer h follows the same topology as G. Therefore, a forward propagation sequence can be generated by traversing G, on the condition that one node should not be processed until all its predecessors are processed. The hidden layer h (vi) is represented as a nonlinear function over its local input x (vi) and the summarization of hidden representation of its predecessors. The local input x (vi) is obtained by aggregating (e.g. average pooling) from constituent elements in the feature tensor x. In detail, the forward operation of DAG-RNNs is calculated by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h (vi) = vj ∈PG (vi) h (vj ) h (vi) =f (U x (vi) + Wĥ (vi) + b) o (vi) =g(V h (vi) + c) (2) where x (vi) , h (vi) , o (vi)</formula><p>are the representations of input, hidden and output layers located at v i respectively, P G (v i ) is the direct predecessor set of vertex v i in the graph G,ĥ (vi) summarizes the information of all the predecessors of v i . Note that the recurrent weight W in Equation 2 is shared across all predecessor vertexes in P G (v i ). We may learn a specific recurrent matrix W for each predecessor when vertexes (except source and sink vertex) if the DAG G have a fixed number of predecessors. In this case, a finer-grained dependency may be captured.</p><p>The derivatives are computed in the backward pass, and each vertex is processed in the reverse order of forward propagation sequence. Specifically, to derive the gradients at v i , we look at equations (besides Equation 2) that involve h (vi) in the forward pass:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∀v k ∈S G (v i ) h (v k ) = f (U x (v k ) + W h (vi) + Wh (v k ) + b) h (v k ) = vj ∈PG (v k )−{vi} h (vj ) (3) where S G (v i ) is the direct successor set for vertex v i in the graph G.</formula><p>It can be inferred from Equation 2, 3 that the errors backpropagated to the hidden layer (dh (vi) )atv i have two sources: direct errors from</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v i ( ∂o (v i ) ∂h (v i ) )</formula><p>, and summation over indirect errors propagated from its successors</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">( v k ∂o (v k ) ∂h (v k ) ∂h (v k ) ∂h (v i ) )</formula><p>. The derivatives at v i can then be computed by the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∆V (vi) = g ′ (o (vi) )(h (vi) ) T dh (vi) = V T g ′ (o (vi) )+ v k ∈SG (vi) W T dh (v k ) • f ′ (h (v k ) ) ∆W (vi) = v k ∈SG (vi) dh (v k ) • f ′ (h (v k ) )(h (vi) ) T ∆U (vi) = dh (vi) • f ′ (h (vi) )(x (vi) ) T</formula><p>(4) where • denotes the Hadamard product. By abuse of notation, g ′ (·)= ∂L ∂o ∂o ∂g is the derivative of loss function L with respect to the output function g, and f ′ (·)= ∂h ∂f . <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> It is the second term of dh <ref type="bibr">(vi)</ref> in Equation 4 that enables DAG-RNNs to propagate local information, which behaves similarly to the message passing <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> in probabilistic graphic models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Decomposition</head><p>We decompose the UCG U to a set of DAGs G U = {G 1 ,...,G d ,...}. Hence, the UCG-structured image is represented as the combination of a set of DAG-structured images. Next, DAG-RNNs are applied independently to each DAG-structured image, and the corresponding hidden layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Here, g (and f ) are composition functions. For instance, o = g(p(h)) where p(h)=V h + c. ∂o ∂g actually refers to ∂o ∂p(h) . h d is generated. The aggregation of the independent hidden layers yields the output layer o. These operations can be mathematically expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h (vi) d = f (U d x (vi) + vj ∈PG d (vi) W d h (vj ) d + b d ) o (vi) = g( G d ∈G U V d h (vi) d + c)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where U d ,W d ,V d and b d are weight matrices and bias vector for the DAG G d ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P G d (v i ) is the direct predecessor set of vertex v i in G d .</formula><p>This decomposition strategy is reminiscent of the tree-reweighted max-product algorithm (TRW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, which represents the problem on the loopy graphs as a convex combination of tree-structured problems. We consider the following criterions for the decomposition. Topologically, the combination of DAGs should be equivalent to the UCG U , so any two vertexes can be reachable. Besides, the combination of DAGs should allow the local information to be routed to anywhere in the image. In our experiment, we use the four context propagation directions (southeast, southwest, northwest and northeast) suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>[23] to decompose the UCG. One example of the induced DAG of the 8-neighborhood UCG in the southeast direction is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Full Labeling Network</head><p>The skeleton architecture of the full labeling network is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. The network is end-to-end trainable, and it takes input as raw RGB images with any size. It outputs the label prediction maps with the same size of inputs. In more detail, the convolution layer is used to produce compact yet highly discriminative features for local regions. Next, the proposed DAG-RNN is used to model the semantic contextual dependencies of local representations. Finally, the deconvolution layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is introduced to upsample the feature maps by learning a set of deconvolution filters.</p><p>To train the network, we adopt the average weighted cross entropy loss. It is formally written as: where N is the number of image units in image I; w is the class weight vector, in which w j stands for the weight for class j; y (vi) is the binary label indicator vector for the image unit located in v i ;õ (vi) is the corresponding class likelihood vector, which is upsampled fromô (vi) by the deconvolution layer. The errors propagated from DAG-RNNs to the convolution layer for image unit v i are calculated based on the following equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">L = − 1 N vi∈I c j=1 w j y (vi) j log(õ (vi) j ) o = deconv(ô)<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆x (vi) = G d ∈G U U T d dh (vi) d • f ′ (h (vi) d ).<label>(7)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Attention to Rare Classes</head><p>In scene images, the class distribution is extremely imbalanced. Namely, very few classes account for large percentage of pixels in images. An example is demonstrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>. It's therefore common to put more attention to rare classes, in order to boost their recognition precisions.</p><p>In the patch-based CNN training, Farabet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Shuai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> oversample the rare-class pixels to address this issue. (Different sampling methods are introduced and discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.) It's however inapplicable to adopt this strategy in our network training, which is a complex structure learning problem. Meanwhile, as the classes are distributed severely unequally in scene images, it's also problematic to weight classes according to their inverse frequencies. As an example, the frequency ratio between the most frequent (sky) and the most rare class (moon) on the Sift-Flow dataset is 3.5 × 10 4 . If the above class weighting criterion is adopted like in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>[17], the frequent classes will be under-attended. Hence, we define the weighting function w as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">w j = k ⌈log10(η/fj )⌉<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where ⌈·⌉ is the integer ceiling operator, f j is the occurrence frequency of the class j, η denotes the threshold that discriminates the rare classes. Specifically, a class is identified as rare if its frequency is smaller than η, otherwise, it is a frequent class. k is a constant that controls the importance of rare classes (k =2in our experiments). The proposed weighting function has the following properties: (1), it attends to rare classes by assigning them higher weights; (2), the degree of attention for rare classes grows exponentially based on their ratio magnitudes w.r.t the threshold η;W e use the following criterion to determine the value of η: the accumulated frequency of all the non-rare classes is 85%. We call it 85%-15% rule, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> uses a similar rule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>We justify our method on three popular and challenging real-world scene image labeling benchmarks: SiftFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, CamVid <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Barcelona <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Two types of scores are reported: the percentage of all correctly classified pixels (Global), and average per-class accuracy (Class).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Baselines</head><p>The convolution neural network (CNN), which jointly learns features and classifiers is used as our first baseline. In this case, the parameters are optimized to maximize the independent prediction accuracy for local patches. Another baseline is the network that shares the same architecture with our DAG-RNNs, while removes the recurrent connections. Mathematically, the W d and b d in Equation 5 are fixed to 0 . In this case, the DAG-recurrent neural network degenerates to an ensemble of four plain two-layer neural networks <ref type="figure">(CNN-ENN)</ref>. The performance disparity between the baselines and DAG-RNNs clearly illuminates the efficacy of our dependency modeling method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Implementation Details</head><p>We use the following two networks to be the convolution layers in our experiments:</p><p>• CNN-65: The network consists of five convolutional layers, the kernel sizes of which are 8 × 8 × 3 × 64, 6 × 6 × 64 × 128, 5 × 5 × 128 × 256, 4 × 4 × 256 × 256 and 1×1×256×64 respectively. Each of the first three convolutional layers are followed by a ReLU and nonoverlapping 2 × 2 max pooling layer. The parameters of this network is learned from image patches (65×65) of the target dataset only (Setting 1).</p><p>• VGG-conv5: The network borrows its architecture and parameters from VGG-verydeep-16 net <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In detail, we discard all the layers after the 5 th pooling layer to yield the desired convolution layer. The network is pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the target dataset. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (Setting 2).</p><p>In DAG-RNNs, the adopted non-linear functions (refer to Equation 2) are ReLU <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for hidden neurons: f (x)= max(0,x) and sof tmax for output layer g. The dimensionality of hidden layer h is empirically set to 64 for CNN-65 and 128 for VGG-conv5 respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>  ments, we consider two UCGs with 4 and 8 neighborhood systems. Their induced DAGs in the northwestern direction are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. In comparison with DAG(4), DAG(8) enables information to be propagated in shorter paths, which is critical to prevent the long-range information from vanishing. As exemplified in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>, the length of propagation path from v 9 to v 1 in G 8 nw is halved to that in G 4 nw (4 → 2 steps). In practice, we apply the function g after the deconvolution layer. The upsampling factor for the deconvolution layer is set to be 2 and 4 for CNN-65 and VGG-conv5 respectively. Namely, the ground truth maps are subsampled during training, while the label prediction maps are further upsampled by bilinear operation in the testing (validation) phase.</p><p>The full labeling network is trained by stochastic gradient descent with momentum. The parameters are updated after one image finishes its forward and backward passes. The learning rate is initialized to be 10 −3 , and decays exponentially with the rate of 0.9 after 10 epoch. The reported results are based on the model trained in 35 epoches. We tune the parameters and diagnoses the network performance based on CNN-65. We also include the results of VGG-conv5 to see whether our proposed DAG-RNNs are beneficial for the highly discriminative representation from the state-of-the-art VGG-verydeep-16 net <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p></div>

By adding DAG-RNN(8), our network reaches 81.1% (48.2%) on global (class) accuracy 4 , which outperforms the baseline (CNN-65-ENN) by 5% (11.2%). Meanwhile, we observe promising accuracy gain (global: 0.6% / class: 5.6% ) by switching DAG-RNN (4) to DAG-RNN (8), in which we believe that long-range dependencies are better captured as information propagation paths in DAG <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> are shorter than those in DAG(4). Such performance benefits can be observed consistently on the CamVid (0.5% / 2.0%) and Barcelona (1.1% / 1.6%) datasets, as evidenced in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2 and 3</ref> respectively. Moreover, in comparison with other representation learning nets, which are fed with much richer contextual input (133×133 patch in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, 3scale 46×46 patches in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>), our DAG-RNNs outperform theirs by a large margin. Importantly, our results match the state-of-the-art under this setting. Furthermore, we initialize our convolution layers with VGG-verydeep-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which has been proven to be the state-of-the-art feature extractor.

By explicitly modeling contextual dependencies among image units, our CNN-65-DAG-RNN(8) brings phenomenal performance benefit (4.6% and 10.2% for the global and class accuracy respectively).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Effects of DAG-RNNs to Per-class Accuracy</head><p>In this section, we investigate the effects of our DAG-RNNs for each class. The detailed per-class accuracy for the SiftFlow dataset is listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>. Under setting 1, we find that the contextual information encoded through our DAG-RNN(8) is beneficial for almost all classes. In this case, the local representations from CNN-65 are not strong, so their discriminative power can be greatly enhanced by modeling their dependencies. In line with it, we observe remarkable performance benefit (+11.2%) for almost all classes. Under setting 2, the VGG-conv5 net is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and it recognizes most classes excellently. Notwithstanding the local representations are highly discriminative in this situation, our DAG-RNN(8) further tremendously improves their representative power for rare classes. Statistically, we observe a phenomenal 8.6% accuracy gain for rare classes. Under both settings, modeling the dependencies among local features enables the classification to be contextual aware. Therefore, the local ambiguities are mitigated to a large extent. However, we fail to observe commensurate accuracy improvements for extremelysmall-size and rare 'object' classes (e.g. bird and bus), we conjecture that the weak local information may have been overwhelmed by context (e.g. a small bird is swallowed by the broad sky in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Discussion of Modeled Dependency</head><p>We show a number of qualitative labeling results in Figure 6. By looking into them, we can have some interesting observations. The DAG-RNNs are capable of (1), enforcing local consistency: neighborhood pixels are likely to be assigned to the same labels. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 6</ref>, the left-panel examples show that confusing regions are smoothed by using our DAG-RNNs. (2), ensuring semantic coherence: the pixels that are spatially far away are usually given labels that could co-occur in a meaningful scene. For example, the 'desert' and 'mountain' classes are usually not seen together with 'trees' in a 'open country' scene, so they are corrected to 'stone' in the second example of the right panel. More examples of this kind are shown in the right panel. These results illuminate that useful contextual dependencies may have been captured by our DAG-RNNs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose DAG-RNNs to model the contextual dependencies of local features. DAG-RNNs are able to encode the global gist of images to local features, so their discriminative power can be enhanced. Furthermore, the proposed class weighting function is experimentally proved to be effective towards the recognition enhancement for rare classes. Integrating with the convolution and deconvolution layers, our DAG-RNNs achieve state-of-the-art results on three challenging scene labeling benchmarks. We also demonstrate that useful contexts are captured by our DAG-RNNs, which is helpful for generating smooth and semantically sensible labeling maps in practice.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>An 8-neighborhood UCG and one of its induced DAG in the southeastern (SE) direction.</figDesc></figure>
