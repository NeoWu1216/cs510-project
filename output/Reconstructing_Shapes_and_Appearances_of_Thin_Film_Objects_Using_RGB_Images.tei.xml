<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Reconstruction of shapes and appearances of thin film objects can be applied to many fields such as industrial inspection, biological analysis, and archaeologic research. However, it comes with many challenging issues because the appearances of thin film can change dramatically depending on view and light directions. The appearance is deeply dependent on not only the shapes but also the optical parameters of thin film. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate shapes and film thickness. First, we narrow down candidates of zenith angle by degree of polarization and determine it by the intensity of thin film which increases monotonically along the zenith angle. Second, we determine azimuth angle from occluding boundaries. Finally, we estimate the film thickness by comparing a look-up table of color along the thickness and zenith angle with captured images. We experimentally evaluated the accuracy of estimated shapes and appearances and found that our proposed method is effective.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Reconstructing the shapes and appearances of real objects is an important issue in the computer vision and computer graphics fields. Several of the current reconstruction methods issue reflectance properties which describes the reflection between reflected and incoming light. However, objects in the real world have quite a few different reflectance properties such as diffusion, specularity, isotropy, anisotropy, scattering, refraction, and interference. Among these, interference has been less explored due to difficult elements such as dramatically varying color along the lighting and viewing directions. Such interference effects are observed on the thin layer over object surfaces such as laminated film, soap bubbles, and oil film. Although it can be difficult, thin film modeling is applied in many areas such as industrial inspection, biological analysis, and archaeological research.</p><p>In computer graphics, several methods have shown that a physical model of interference can represent appearances well. However, this type of a model requires optical parameters (refractive index and film thickness) to determine appearances. In optics fields, there are several methods to estimate optical parameters, such as the refractive index and film thickness of a planar object. Interference spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and ellipsometry are representative methods. <ref type="bibr">Kitagawa</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> proposed an image-based method, that utilizes RGB values along the film thickness, but this method requires a known refractive index. Some applications such as archaeological applications require the thickness of a curved surface to be measured, meaning that they cannot be applied to non-planar surfaces. Kobayashi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> proposed a method for thin film objects that have a complicated shape. The problem with this method, though, is that it needs spectral images for the analysis, and thus the data dimensionality becomes high due to the high volume of memory and computational complexity required.</p><p>In this paper, we proposes a novel method to estimate the shapes and film thickness of an object with thin film layers by using only RGB images. The shape of an object is estimated on the basis of polarization and intensity change along the zenith angle. From the observed color and obtained object shape, the method compares color change of a simulated result with the observed image, and then determines film thickness from the closest color.</p><p>The three main contributions of this work are as follows. First, while conventional methods use spectral sensors, we use only a commercial available digital camera, resulting in less data to be processed. Second, our method can obtain both the shape and film thickness of a target object. Third, we have developed a novel measurement apparatus that can capture the whole reflectance of a thin film at once.</p><p>The proposed method comes with several assumptions. First, the target object must have a single thin film on its surface. Second, the object surface must be geometrically smooth and closed with no self-occlusion. This assumption is necessary to disambiguate azimuth angles. If a rough shape of the object is known, this assumption is not necessary. Third, the refractive index of the object must be known in order for the polarization to narrow down candidates of the zenith angle. Fourth, there must be no (or very little) inter reflection or subsurface scattering. Finally, the observed light must be only interference reflection from thin film, because interference light can be observed when the observed angle is the same as the incident angle on the surface normal.</p><p>The rest of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss several existing methods of reconstructing shapes and appearances for various reflection properties. In Section 3, we propose our method of estimating the shapes of thin film objects on the basis of polarization analysis. In Section 4, we describe the representation of thin film appearances in RGB space, and in Section 5, we introduce the measurement equipment of our method, the procedure of the shape estimation, and the method for estimating film thickness. In Section 6, we present experimental results and discuss the accuracy of our method. We conclude in Section 7 with a brief summary and mention the future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Various methods to acquire the appearances of objects in the real world have been proposed. In computer vision fields, appearances are defined by a bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) that represents reflectance along the view and light directions. Holroyd et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Dana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> constructed a BRDF look-up table in which they controlled the illumination and view directions by positioning the light, sensor, and sample sequentially. Mukaigawa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and Dana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> have used an ellipsoidal mirror to measure the reflection of all directions at once. However, these methods are centered on reflection, which does not dramatically vary the appearance.It is thus difficult to apply these methods to thin film objects.</p><p>There are several methods to estimate shapes and appearances simultaneously. A representative method is the photometric stereo <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>,which is applied to various reflectance properties such as diffusion, specularity, isotropy, and anisotropy. This method usually estimates shapes while fitting a reflectance model with captured images. However, when the reflectance of transparent objects is too complicated, this method does not work well. Several methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>[19] <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>[15] <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> have been proposed to estimate the shapes of transparent objects using polarization.</p><p>In computer graphics, there are several methods to render <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Relation between incident plane and azimuth angle.x and y are coordinates in camera view. φ is rotation angle at perpendicular polarization. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Sum of RGB values along zenith angle. The refractive index of thin film is 1.36 and that of bottom layer is 1.6. Film thickness is 400 nm. Sensitivity of the camera is EOS 5D <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> structural color caused by thin film, multiple films, refraction, and diffraction grating. Hirayama et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> have rendered multi-film interference focusing on a physical model while Sun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> models the micro-structure of CDs precisely and reconstruct it realistically. Using the model of refraction among water droplets, Sadeghi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have rendered a rainbow the same as a real images. Cuypers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> uses the Wigner distribution function to model diffraction grating. They compare this model with reflectance from objects in the real world and show that it can represent the appearance as precisely as a physical model. Using a physical model, these methods can represent appearances well, but the model parameters need to be set manually, which means we need to estimate the parameters of the physical model in order to reconstruct the thin film appearance well.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 Z e n i t h A n g l e [ d e g ] S u m o f R G B V a l u e</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Shape Estimation</head><p>In this section, we propose a shapes reconstruction method based on polarization and reflectance intensity analysis of thin film objects. The polarization and reflectance intensity are explained in the following.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Polarization</head><p>Light has the characteristics of an electromagnetic wave. The polarization of reflected light can be divided by parallel and perpendicular polarization. The parallel polarization is parallel light along the incident plane and the perpendicular polarization is vertical light along the incident plane. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, the azimuth angle is vertical along the incident plane and the perpendicular polarization is parallel to the azimuth angle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Zenith Angle</head><p>We focus on two features to estimate zenith angles. The first feature is the degree of polarization (DOP), which can narrow down candidates to two zenith angles. The second one is the intensity of perpendicular polarization, which monotonically increases as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. In this section, we propose a method to estimate zenith angles using these two features.</p><p>When the polarizer is rotated, the observed intensity is changed along the rotating angle. We can obtain the degree of polarization (DOP) by using the maximum and minimum intensities among polarized images, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>. The refractive indices are the same as <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. DOP is represented as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ρ = I max − I min I max + I min<label>(1)</label></formula><p>The I max and I min can be theoretically defined as amplitude of Fresnel reflection and transmittance as A schematic diagram of thin film is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>. The amplitude of the Fresnel reflection and transmittance at the top layer are represented as Eq. (4), (5), <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>. In the case of the bottom layer, the equations can be similar to the top layer's equations. n 1 , n 2 , and n 3 are the refractive indices of the incoming medium, thin film, and outgoing medium, respectively. θ 1 is zenith angle. θ 2 is refracting angle. θ 3 is angle of outgoing light transmitting the thin film. In our method, we assume that the incoming medium is air, so n 1 = 1.0.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">I max = I s = (R s (t) + T s (t)R s (b)T s (b))I (2) I min = I p = (R p (t) + T p (t)R p (b)T p (b))I (3) where R s (t), R p (t)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">R s (t) = n 1 cos θ 1 − n 2 cos θ 2 n 1 cos θ 1 + n 2 cos θ 2 2 (4) R p (t) = n 2 cos θ 1 − n 1 cos θ 2 n 2 cos θ 1 + n 1 cos θ 2 2 (5) Z e n i t h A n g l e [ d e g ] D O P B r e w s t e r a n g l e A m b i g u i t y p r o b l e m S</formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">T s (t) = tan θ 1 tan θ 2 2 sin θ 2 cos θ 1 sin(θ 1 + θ 2 ) 2 (6) T p (t) = tan θ 1 tan θ 2 2 sin θ 2 cos θ 1 sin(θ 1 + θ 2 ) cos(θ 1 − θ 2 ) 2 (7)</formula><p>Here, we can calculate the DOP along the zenith angle if we know the refractive index of the thin film and bottom layer.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, the DOP has two solutions across the Brewster angle. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3</ref>, the vertical axis is the value of DOP and the horizontal axis is the zenith angle from 0 to 90 degrees. To solve before the ambiguity, we came up with the following method. We can divide by two regions, e.g., a larger region and a smaller region. The larger region has a larger angle than the Brewster angle and the smaller region has a smaller one. The intensity of perpendicular polarization can be calculated from Eqs. (2), (4), and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. When the intensity becomes larger than that of the Brewster angle, we can determine that region as the larger region and can then detect the zenith angle in the larger region. The reverse is true when the intensity is smaller than that of the Brewster angle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Azimuth Angle</head><p>We can estimate azimuth angles by using perpendicular polarization. We detect rotation angles observing perpendicular polarization and estimate azimuth angles. When the polarizer is rotated, the intensity of captured images is changed from bright to dark among a 180 • polarizer rotation. As mentioned in the previous section, azimuth angle is parallel to perpendicular polarization. Therefore, the rotation angle is equal to azimuth angle when we observe maximum intensity. However, there are two maximum intensities. If we define one angle as φ, the other one becomes φ + 180 • . We can solve this ambiguity by using the occluding boundaries of the target object.</p><p>Then, we assume that surface normal directs outwards. When the occluding boundary is closed, the integrated value  of surface normal in a small region becomes 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∫ ∫ ∫ C f (x, y, z)dxdydz = 0<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where C is the small region area on target objects. We estimate azimuth angles of whole objects with the following steps. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Appearance of Thin Film Reflectance in RGB Space</head><p>In this section, we describe the appearance of thin film object in RGB color space. Our method can be used with a regular digital camera. Observed RGB values are represented by integration of observed spectra. The observed spectrum is a multiplication of the camera sensitivity, reflectance, and illumination spectrum in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">I RGB = ∫ S RGB (λ)R(λ)E(λ)dλ<label>(9)</label></formula><p>I RGB is observed RGB value. S RGB (λ) is camera sensitivity function. R(λ) and E(λ) are reflectance and illumination spectra, respectively. The reflectance spectra of thin film R(λ) is defined by R(λ) = r 12 + r 23 e i∆ 1 + r 23 r 12 e i∆ 2 (10) r 12 and r 23 are Fresnel coefficients and represented by Eqs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(12)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(14)</ref> for perpendicular and parallel polarization. r s 12 = n 1 cos θ 1 − n 2 cos θ 2 n 1 cos θ 1 + n 2 cos θ 2 (11) r p 12 = n 2 cos θ 1 − n 1 cos θ 2 n 2 cos θ 1 + n 1 cos θ 2 (12) r s 23 = n 2 cos θ 2 − n 3 cos θ 3 n 2 cos θ 2 + n 3 cos θ 3</p><p>r p 23 = n 3 cos θ 2 − n 2 cos θ 3 n 3 cos θ 2 + n 2 cos θ 3</p><p>∆ in Eq. (10) is phase difference.</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∆ = 2πϕ λ<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where ϕ is an optical path difference determined by a distance between point A and point F in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>. The distance is ACF − DF . Considering a light going into a medium with refractive index n 2 , the light speed in thin film is defined by n 2 c, where c is the light speed in the air. Therefore, the optical path difference becomes n 2 ACF − n 1 DF . In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>, n 1 is the refractive index in the air, so n 1 = 1. The optical path difference DF is equal to n 2 AB.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">n 2 ACF − DF = n 2 BCF<label>(16)</label></formula><p>The optical path difference BCF is equal to BCF ′ = 2d cos θ 2 since F ′ is symmetrical point F .</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ϕ = n 2 BCF = 2dn 2 cos θ 2<label>(17)</label></formula><p>Therefore, in Eq. (10), a zenith angle θ 1 , refractive indices n 2 , n 3 , and film thickness d are important parameters for appearances. In our case, only film thickness d is unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Implementation</head><p>In this section, we propose the novel measurement equipment and, explain how this equipment is used to estimate both the shape and film thickness. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> shows the measurement equipment for polarized images of thin film objects. This equipment consists of a geodesic dome, LED light, white plastic sphere as a diffuser, a RGB camera, and a linear polarizer. The spectrum of LED light is preferable because it is similar to the spectrum of daylight illumination. We use a Canon EOS 5D Mark2 as a conventional RGB camera, the sensitivity of which has been measured by Kawakami et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Measurement Equipment</head><p>Using this equipment, we can capture appearances of an object under omnidirectional illumination, since the interference light can be observed when the incident angle of light and the observed angle on normal is the same. In our equipment, we place the LED lights at the vertex of the geodesic dome and a plastic sphere for diffusing light around the target object. <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> shows the procedure to estimate the shape of thin film objects. The estimation method is roughly divided into three steps. First, we capture polarized images by rotating the polarizer from 0 to 180 degrees. The latter two steps, which are performed independently of each other, are for estimating the zenith and azimuth angles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Procedure of Shape Estimation</head><p>First, we store the pixel intensities in the captured image sequence. Second, we detect the maximum and minimum intensities in the captured image sequence and calculate the DOP in each pixel. Third, using the calculated DOP, we determine two candidates of the zenith angle. Finally, we determine the zenith angle using Section 3.2.</p><p>The azimuth angle estimation is as follows. First, we detect the angle of maximum intensity in each pixel of the captured image sequence. Next, the azimuth angles in the whole region can be estimated using the method in Section 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Procedure for Appearance Reconstruction</head><p>In this section, we propose a method to estimate film thickness. When we know the refractive index of a thin film, we can simulate the appearance along the zenith angle and film thickness by using Eq. 10. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig.  7</ref> whose optical parameters are the same as in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>, the appearance can be determined uniquely for the zenith angle and the film thickness. However, we can observe a similar appearance repeatedly along the film thickness. When we input the appearance at a certain zenith angle and take the least square minimum between observed appearance and <ref type="table">C  a  p  t  u  r  e  P  o  l  a  r  i  z  e  d  I  m  a  g  e  s   Z  e  n  i  t  h  A  n  g  l  e  E  s  t  i  m  a  t  i  o  n   A  z  i  m  u  t  h  A  n  g  l  e  E  s  t  i  m  a  t  i</ref>  simulated appearance, we can find the local minimum along the film thickness. Therefore, we need to know the rough range of the film thickness in advance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Experiment</head><p>In this section, we investigate the validity of our method by simulation. We also verify the effectiveness of our method with real objects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Simulation</head><p>We investigated the accuracy of the film thickness estimation and found that the accuracy of azimuth angles depends on the detection accuracy of the rotation angle of the polarizer. The accuracy of the rotation angle has previously been evaluated <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>[14] <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, so in this section, we examine only the accuracy of the film thickness estimation. We use reflectance spectra measured with a spectrometer as input data. We put the target object and light source on a rotation table and changed the zenith angle from 10 to 50 degrees by 5-deg increment. The material used for the thin film is M gF 2 with a refractive index of 1.36. The material of the bottom layer is a polyethylene terephthalate(PET) film with a refractive index of 1.6. The ground truth of film thickness is 630 nm. Tab. 1 shows the estimated film thickness and RMSE between measured reflectance and reflectance model with ground truth optical parameters. The average error is 6.56 nm. At 15 and 50 degrees, the error is over 10 nm. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Measurement of Real Object</head><p>In this section, we demonstrate the measurement of a few real objects using our equipment. For this experiment, we used a cylindrical object, and a quadrangular pyramid button with M gF 2 evaporated on their surfaces. The bottom layer of the cylindrical object is PET film with a refractive index of 1.6 and film thickness of 400 nm. The planar thin film was rolled up onto the cylindrical object.</p><p>The quadrangular pyramid object is made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) resin with a refractive index of 1.5. It had M gF 2 directly evaporated on its surface, the film thickness of which was 630 nm. Physical vapor deposition is generally used for planar objects, but there is no guarantee that film thickness is evaporated uniformly on non-planar objects. However, our method can measure spatial normal and thickness on a non-planar object.</p><p>First, we show the estimated results of the zenith angle in <ref type="figure">Figs</ref> Third, Figs. 10 show the results of estimated film thickness. The thickness is around 400 nm for the cylindrical object. However, the thickness of the quadrangular pyramid object varied greatly from 400 nm to 690 nm.</p><p>Finally, we show the reconstructed appearance images using our method in Figs. 11. We evaluated the color difference between captured and reconstructed images. The color difference is defined by Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> in CIE Lab color space. CIE defined the difference level of human perception between two colors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">∆ = √ ∆L 2 + ∆a 2 + ∆b 2<label>(18)</label></formula><p>The color difference of the cylindrical object, 0.64, is perceived as Slight . The color difference of the quadrangular pyramid, 3.0, is perceived as Noticeable .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Discussion</head><p>In this section, we discuss the errors of the simulation and experiment with real objects. First, we examine the thickness error in the simulation. We calculate RMSE between measured reflectance spectra and spectra with ground truth film thickness. RMSE became larger at 15 and 50 degrees, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>. This result indicates that the input reflectance is affected by noise.</p><p>We examine the errors of the experiment with real objects. First, we consider that the error is caused by zenith angle error and azimuth angle error. The difference between the zenith angle error in Figs. 8 and surface normal in Figs. 9 is almost the same. Hence, the error of azimuth angle is almost zero.</p><p>Second, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 12</ref> shows reflectances of perpendicular and parallel polarization along the zenith angle. The optical parameters are the same as <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. We consider that the error of zenith angles is caused by the noise in input intensity in the lower angle, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 12</ref>. In this area, the difference in angle estimation is quite small with a certain intensity difference. This indicates that the estimated zenith angle is sensitive to noise.</p><p>Third, we can recognize the smooth spatial thickness of both objects, but we do not know the ground truth of thickness in Figs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref>. Physical vapor deposition is subject to evaporating thin film: the thinner it is and the farther away from center of the target objects it is. Our results confirm this effect.</p><p>Finally, we discuss the difference of the reconstructed appearances in Figs. 11. In our method, we were able to estimate the optical parameters of thin film, such as spatial normal and spatial thickness by a regular digital camera. As shown in Figs. 11, the complex appearance changes of thin film can be represented. In the future, we will discuss how to improve our method for more accurate reconstruction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a novel method to estimate the shape and appearance of thin film objects using RGB images. By our method, we can determine both the shape and thickness of thin film objects using a regular digital still camera and measure the thin film object easily. We also developed the measurement equipment to capture whole reflectance images of thin film objects at once. In this paper, our focus was thin film objects with a single layer, but theoretically our method can also be applied to the reconstruction of the shape of multi-layered thin film objects. At the moment, it is difficult to estimate film thickness at each layer of a multilayered thin film. In the future, we will extend our method to model multi-layered thin film objects. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>are the reflections of the top layer, R s (b), R p (b) are the reflections of bottom layer, T s (t), T p (t) are the transmittance coefficients of the top layer, and T s (b), T p (b) are the transmittance coefficients of the bottom layer.</figDesc></figure>
