<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many non-rigid 3D structures are not modelled well through a low-rank subspace assumption. This is problematic when it comes to their reconstruction through Structure from Motion (SfM). We argue in this paper that a more expressive and general assumption can be made around compressible 3D structures. The vision community, however, has hitherto struggled to formulate effective strategies for recovering such structures after projection without the aid of additional priors (e.g. temporal ordering, rigid substructures, etc.). In this paper we present a "prior-less" approach to solve compressible SfM. Specifically, we demonstrate how the problem of SfM -assuming compressible 3D structures -can be theoretically characterized as a block sparse dictionary learning problem. We validate our approach experimentally by demonstrating reconstructions of 3D structures that are intractable using current state-of-theart low-rank SfM approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A 3D shape can often be well-approximated as a linear combination of just a few elements from a set of basis or dictionary. When this approximation is exact we say that the 3D shape is sparse. In reality, few real-world 3D shapes are truly sparse, rather they are "compressible" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, meaning they can be well-approximated by a sparse 3D shape. A scenario often entertained in Sf M literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> is that the same few K dictionary bases can be employed for approximating a set of 3D shape instances (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(a))these fixed set of basis vectors form the canonical low-rank 3D assumption. We shall refer herein to the finite set of 3D shape instances as the 3D structure.</p><p>In compressible Sf M we make a similar assumption to classical low-rank Sf M <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> where we assume each 3D shape instance can be described using only K dictionary bases, but a different set of K basis vectors can be employed for each shape instance (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(b)). These set of 3D shape instances do not form a single linear subspace, they <ref type="bibr">Figure 1</ref>: In this paper we explore the problem of "compressible" structure from motion (Sf M). In this approach we assume a set of 3D shapes, stemming from a non-rigid 3D structure, can be well approximated by a few (i.e. K) examples of elements from an unknown basis or dictionary. Classical low-rank Sf M makes a similar assumption but assumes that the same K elements within the dictionary will be used to approximate all 3D shape instances -see (a). Our approach differs in this regard, where we allow for the employment of different K elements within the dictionary for each 3D instance -see (b). We describe a novel algorithm, based on block sparse dictionary learning, for obtaining Sf M reconstructions that were previously deemed intractable using the low-rank assumption employed by current state-of-the-art methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>can instead be thought of as existing in a union of L K subspaces where L is the total number of basis vectors available. An obvious advantage of this compressible 3D structure assumption is the ability to model a much broader set of 3D structures. A drawback to the assumption, however, is discovering which of the potentially very large number of L K subspaces best describes the actual 3D shape instance -solely from its 2D projection. It is this dilemma which is at the heart of our paper.</p><p>Contributions: In this paper we make the following contributions:</p><p>• We demonstrate that a compressible 3D structure under weak perspective projection is 2 × 3 blockcompressible. Based on this insight, we re-interpret compressible Sf M as a block sparse dictionary learning problem. • We theoretically characterize the uniqueness of block sparse dictionary learning. Further, we show how the uniqueness of block sparse dictionary learning can be utilized to efficiently recover the camera motion and 3D structures. We also propose the employment of dictionary coherence as a measure of reconstructibility of the 3D structures without ground truth. • Finally, we show empirically the utility of our approach for reconstructing compressible 3D structures using a block-sparse adaptation of the K-SVD algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Impressive reconstruction results are reported on both synthetic and real-world compressible 3D structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>Weak perspective Sf M deals with the problem of factorizing an image measurement matrix W as the product of camera motion (projection) matrix M and a shape S, such that,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">W = M S<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where S is the 3D structure consisting of P points deforming over F frames, resulting in a 3F × P concatenated matrix of points <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Throughout this paper we consider weak perspective cameras, which is a reasonable assumption for objects whose variation in depth is small compared to their distance from the camera. We further assume that the measurement matrix is already centered, so the camera matrix reduces to a 2F × 3F block diagonal matrix whose blocks M 1 . . . M F are each 2 × 3 matrices. The weak perspective camera assumption implies an orthonormal constraint such that M f M T f = σ 2 I 2 . A common assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> is to constrain the reconstructed 3D set to have fixed rank K such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">S ♯ = C ♯ B ♯ where B ♯ ∈ R K×3P , C ♯ ∈ R F ×K and S ♯ is a F × 3P reshape of S such that W = M (C ♯ ⊗ I 3 )B = ΠB<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where I 3 is a 3×3 identity matrix, B is the 3K ×P reshape of the matrix B ♯ and Π = M (C ♯ ⊗ I 3 ).</p><p>Rigid Sf M: For a rigid 3D structure,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S ♯ =    s T x , s T y , s T z . . . . . . . . . s T x , s T y , s T z    S = s x , s y , s z . . . s x , s y , s z T<label>(3)</label></formula><p>it is clear that the rank of S ♯ must be one <ref type="table">(K = 1)</ref> where s x , s y and s z are the P dimensional components of the x−, y− and z− coordinates of the rigid 3D structure. From Equation 3 this implies that S must have a rank of less than or equal to three due to the reshaping operation on S ♯ . This insight was used to great effect through the seminal work of Tomasi &amp; Kanade <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> who demonstrated that one can compute the decomposition W =ΠB via an SVD by preserving the first 3 modes of variation. Tomasi &amp; Kanade also noted that the decomposition is non-unique, such that any nonsingular G can be inserted to form a valid factorization W =ΠB =ΠGG −1B = ΠB. The matrix G is referred to in literature as the corrective transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Low-Rank Sf M: Bregler et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> extended the work of Tomasi &amp; Kanade by assuming that S ♯ must be of fixed rank K &gt; 1 for non-rigid structure. Numerous innovations have followed, most of them centered around introducing additional "priors" to make the non-rigid Sf M problem less ambiguous. Notable examples of additional priors include: basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, temporal <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, articulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, and camera motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> constraints. These priors, although useful for making the low-rank Sf M problem tractable, considerably limit its applicability to scenarios where these constraints do not hold.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Related Work</head><p>"Prior-less" Sf M: Of particular interest in this paper is the recent work of Dai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, who asked the question: what are the minimal set of constraints/priors required to find a unique solution to the problem of low-rank Sf M?</p><p>The authors proposed an approach to whose only prior was to assume that the non-rigid 3D structure could be represented by a linear subspace of known rank K. In this work Dai et al. proposed a strategy for estimating the corrective transformation matrix G whereby both the camera motion M and the 3D structure S can be obtained. This approach offered a practical breakthrough to the problem of low-rank Sf M, which had previously been touted <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> as being theoretically impossible to solve without additional prior/constraints. In this paper we want to ask a similar question: what are the minimal set of constraints/priors required to find a unique solution to the problem of compressible Sf M?</p><p>Manifold Sf M: Notable efforts have been previously undertaken in literature to replace the low-rank linear subspace assumption with a manifold learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Most notable is the recent work of Gotardo and Martinez <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> who demonstrated how the "kernel trick" could be employed to model 3D shape as a non-linear subspace. A drawback to this approach, however, was its reliance on additional basis constraints limiting the approach's applicability to the prior-less Sf M problems of interest within this paper. There is some overlap between our proposed method here, as it has been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that the field of manifold learning has a strong link to the recovery of compressed signals. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that a set of K sparse signals forms a K-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Further, it can be shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that many manifold models can be expressed as an infinite union of subspaces.</p><p>Union of subspaces Sf M: Recently, Zhu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> demonstrated a strategy for utilizing a union of local subspaces assumption within Sf M. Specifically, the authors utilized an adaptation of Dai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> Sf M approach -which simultaneously reconstruct the 3D structure and affinity matrix. The affinity matrix is of importance as it naturally encodes the cluster/subspace membership of each projected shape sample. Although exhibiting superior performance to Dai et al.'s approach for 3D structures that do not adhere to the low-rank assumption, the approach requires prior knowledge of the camera motion. Our proposed approach shares some commonalities with Zhu et al.'s work in that we are also making a union of subspaces assumption. An important difference, however, in our proposed approach is that we do not rely on any additional priors other than that the 3D structure is compressible. Specifically, we are able to automatically recover the camera matrices along with the 3D structure from a set of 2D projections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compressible Sf M:</head><p>The assumption that a 3D structure is compressible has been previously explored in Sf M literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Of particular note here is the work of Zhu and Lucey <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> where the authors: (i) assumed that the 3D structure is in a known temporal order, (ii) the camera motions are known, and (iii) the sparse basis is known a priori.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Uniqueness of SDL</head><p>An important component of our paper is associated with the uniqueness of Sparse Dictionary Learning (SDL) as it is sometimes known in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In general terms the problem of SDL can be described as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">arg min D,Z X − DZ 2 F s.t. z i 0 = K, i = 1 : N (4)</formula><p>where we are trying to recover the concatenation of a sparse coefficient matrix Z and dictionary basis D from a known set of signals in X ∈ R D×N . Specifically, the sparse coefficient matrix is the concatenation of K−sparse coefficient vectors Z = z 1 , . . . , z D , and concatenation of D = d 1 , . . . , d M dictionary basis vectors. An important question to ask in the context of applying SDL to Sf M is how unique is the solution to Equation 4?</p><p>Hillar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> recently characterized theoretically the answer to this question. The authors define that if any valid solution {D,Ẑ} to the SDL objective in <ref type="bibr">Equation 4</ref> is ambiguous up to a M × M permutation matrix P and a diagonal invertible weighting matrix Λ such thatD = DP Λ, andẐ = Λ −1 P T Z, they say that X has a unique SDL. Moreover, they proved theoretically that, given large enough N 1 , the uniqueness of SDL is achieved if and only if the dictionary D satisfies the spark condition: 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Dz 1 = Dz 2 for K-sparse z 1 , z 2 ∈ R M ⇒ z 1 = z 2 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Coherence as a proxy: The spark condition provides a complete characterization on the uniqueness of SDL. However, verifying whether a matrix D satisfies the spark condition is an NP-hard problem, which has to visit all M K subspaces. It is preferable in practice to use properties of D that are easily computable such as coherence -which measures the largest absolute inner product between any two column vectors in the matrix -and with high probability is indicative of the spark condition of the matrix. In the experimental portion of this paper we shall demonstrate how the coherence of a matrix can be utilized to predict the reconstructibility of a 3D structure solely from its 2D projections.</p><p>Block SDL: As we will discuss in the next section, there is a strong connection between compressible Sf M and Block SDL (BSDL). BSDL is a generalization of the SDL objective in Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">argmin D,Z ||X − DZ|| 2 F s.t.||Z i || 0,α = K, i = 1 : N/β, (6) where Z i ∈ R D×β is a submatrix of Z, i.e. Z = Z 1 , ..., Z N/β . Each Z i is divided into M /α blocks of size α × β and Z i 0,α</formula><p>counts the number of blocks of which at least one element is non-zero. α and β need to be chosen such that D and M are perfectly divisible. One of particular importance in our compressible Sf M problem is 3×2 block-sparsity which we will describe in more detail in the next section on compressible Sf M.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1. If any valid solution {D,Ẑ} to the objective in Equation 6</head><p>is ambiguous only up to a M × M block permutation matrix P α and a block-diagonal invertible weighting matrix Λ α such thatD = DP α Λ α , and Z = Λ −1 α P T α Z, we say X has a unique BSDL.</p><p>The block permutation matrix is actually defined as P α = P ⊗ I α where P is an arbitrary (M/α) × (M/α) permutation matrix and I α is a α × α identity matrix. The block-diagonal invertible weighting matrix Λ α has a α × α block structure. We now ask the same question: what is the sufficient and necessary condition for the uniqueness of BSDL? Theorem 1. Given large enough N 3 , the uniqueness of BSDL holds if and only if the matrix D satisfies the block spark condition:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">DZ 1 = DZ 2 for K block-sparse Z 1 , Z 2 ∈ R M ×β ⇒ Z 1 = Z 2 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The complete mathematical proof of Theorem 1 is offered in supplementary material. For rigid Sf M (i.e. K = 1) the application of camera constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> is typically sufficient in order to find a correction matrix G that gives a unique solution. Xiao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> famously demonstrated for K &gt; 1 that one cannot determine a unique G since the space of solutions lies in a nullspace of rank 2K 2 − K. Akhter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> additionally demonstrated that even though G is not unique, any solution to G that satisfies the camera constraints returns a valid 3D shape and camera motion pair. In this paper we want to explore whether moving away from canonical rank constraints and instead assuming that Π is block-sparse could result in a far less ambiguous factorization thus resulting in an Sf M algorithm that can circumvent current theoretical and practical limitations.</p><p>Why block-sparse?: Let us assume that the unknown 3D structures S ♯ are compressible, that is, the 3D structure in each frame (each row of S ♯ ) can be approximated by only K basis shapes (K rows of B ♯ .) Therefore, the factorization S ♯ = C ♯ B ♯ results in a set of coefficients C ♯ ∈ R F ×L whose rows are each K-sparse. As pointed out in the previous section, one never has access to the 3D structure S ♯ a priori only the 2D projections W . Interestingly, however, if we know S ♯ is compressible then from Equation 2 (i.e. Π = M (C ♯ ⊗ I 3 )) Π must be 2 × 3 block sparse as the camera matrix M is 2 × 3 block-diagonal. It is this insight that forms the crucial component of our algorithm. From a known measurement matrix W and desired K, L, one can factorize W T through a 3×2 BSDL process. Note: for Sf M W = ΠB, whereas for BSDL this would be expressed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">W T = B T Π T where X = W T , D = B T , and Z = Π T .</formula><p>Theorem 2. If one can recoverB using a 3 × 2 BSDL such that D =B T satisfies the block spark condition, then it can be shown that the transpose ofB ♯ satisfies the canonical spark condition, whereB ♯ is an L × 3P reshape ofB. Further, for such BSDL to be unique, K must be less than or equal to P/3 − 1.</p><p>Proof. Suppose two K-sparse vectors z 1 and z 2 such that (B ♯ ) T z 1 = (B ♯ ) T z 2 . Then from the reshape, it follows thatB T (z 1 ⊗ I 3 ) =B T (z 2 ⊗ I 3 ). AsB T satisfies the block spark condition, it follows that z 1 = z 2 , therefore, (B ♯ ) T satisfies the canonical spark condition. Further, the uniqueness of the BSDL factorization requiresB T to satisfy the block spark condition. This implies that any P ×3(K +1) submatrices generated by concatenating K +1 block columns ofB T needs to be full column rank 4 . Therefore K need to be less than or equal to P/3 − 1.</p><p>Theorem 2 actually tells us that the uniqueness of the BSDL factorization on 2D projections automatically guarantees the uniqueness of the SDL factorization on the unknown 3D structures. Interestingly, the converse is not always true. This result highlights a drawback in our proposed approach, that is, we cannot recover all compressible structures but the subsets whereΠ is sufficiently sparse (K ≤ P/3 − 1) andB satisfies the block spark condition.</p><p>In the experiments section, we show a strategy that can be utilized in practice to improve the incoherence ofB and push it to satisfy the block spark condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Camera and Structure Recovery</head><p>As the scale of camera and size of structures are inherently relative, we simply set the camera scale σ to unity, such that M f M T f = I 2 . Assuming that W =ΠB has a unique BSDL, from Definition 1, the corrective matrix G must be of form G = (P ⊗ I 3 )Λ. As the permutation ambiguity has no bearing on camera motion and 3D structure, we set P to identity, therefore G = Λ.</p><p>Denote G j as j-th block on diagonal of G, and Π j , Π j ∈ R 2F ×3 as the j-th coloumn-triplet ofΠ, Π respectively. From the structure of corrective matrix, it follows that Π j =Π j G j , for j = 1, ..., L. Define Ω j as the set of indices pointing to the blockΠ ij ∈ R 2×3 that is active, i.e. Ω j = supp(Π j ) = {i|1 ≤ i ≤ F,Π ij = 0}. If a certain Ω j is empty, it is implied that the corresponding atom in the dictionary has never been used. We can then decrease L, and re-learn the dictionary so that Ω j is never empty.</p><p>From</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Equation 2 (i.e. W = M (C ♯ ⊗ I 3 )B = ΠB), it is known that Π ij = c ij M i , where c ij is ij−th elements of C ♯ . Thus, since Ω j can never be empty,Π ij G j = Π ij = c ij M i , for each i ∈ Ω j . From camera constraints, it follows thatΠ ij G j G T jΠ T ij = c 2 ij M i M T i = c 2 ij I 2 , i ∈ Ω j ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>and for convenience, let Q j = G j G T j . Since c ij is unknown, let us eliminate it and rewrite <ref type="bibr">Equation 9</ref> as</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">(Π ij Q jΠ T ij ) 11 = (Π ij Q jΠ T ij ) 22 , (Π ij Q jΠ T ij ) 12 = 0,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where (·) ij denotes the (i, j)-th elements. Now, denote q j = vec(Q j ) as the vectorization of Q j . Let us rewrite Equation 10 in a compact way with the fact that vec(Π ij Q jΠij ) = (Π ij ⊗Π ij )q j :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Π ij ⊗Π ij (1, :) −Π ij ⊗Π ij (4, :) Π ij ⊗Π ij (2, :) q j = A ij q j = 0,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>whereΠ ij ⊗Π ij (k, :) denotes k-th row ofΠ ij ⊗Π ij . Stacking all such equations for all i ∈ Ω j , we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">A j q j = 0.<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Circumventing the nullspace: One benefit of Equation 12</p><p>is that A j ∈ R 2|Ωj |×9 , where |Ω j | is the number of elements in set Ω j , with high possibility will be overcomplete as F ≫ L. This result is important as it circumvents the nullspace issue faced by low-rank Sf M. This null space issue can be problematic in many practical scenarios due to its sensitivity to noise. Similar to Tomasi-Kanade's method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we simply pick up the eigenvector corresponding to the least eigenvalue of A T j A j and then Q k ∈ S 3 + holds automatically. Once Q j is estimated, the absolute value of c ij can be computed by <ref type="bibr">Equation 9</ref>. The sign of c ij , however, is not able to be determined, which actually is an inherent ambiguity without assuming any temporal prior of camera or structures. Considering equation W = M S, any block diagonal matrix blkdiag(±I 3 ) can be inserted between M and S, but the compressibility assumption and camera constraint still hold. Dai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> breaks their "prior-free" assertion by restricting the camera movement between frames to at most ±90 • to determine the sign of c ij . In our paper, however, we claim that the absolute sign of c ij cannot be determined by current assumption, but the relative sign in each column can. Thus, the camera matrix and structures can be recovered but up to a sign ambiguity.</p><p>Enforcing camera consistency: Let us consider the submatrix G j in isolation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Π ij G j = c ij M i , for i ∈ Ω j .<label>(13)</label></formula><p>One can recover the camera matrices {M i } i∈Ωj by solving the system of equations above. Further, if one was to then choose another G k where j = k, such that one or more indexes in Ω j are shared with Ω k , one can equally recover the camera matrices {M * i } i∈Ω k . An inconsistency arises, however, such that we cannot guarantee that</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">M * i = M i , for i ∈ Ω j ∩ Ω k .<label>(14)</label></formula><p>This inconsistency does not just occur across pairs of submatrices within G, but actually across all possible submatrices of G with overlapping active blocks. We attempt to resolve this inconsistency in a recursive manner by solving for an orthonormal matrix H k such that M * i H k = M i . First, we choose an arbitrary G j (typically the one with most active blocks) and solve for the cameras {M i } i∈Γ , where we initially set Γ = Ω j . Then we choose a G k whose |Γ ∩ Ω k | is largest. We solve for the cameras {M * i } i∈Ω k , and then find an orthonormal H k such that, arg min</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">H k ,η i∈Γ∩Ω k M i − η i M * i H k F s.t.

For the element in C ♯ that are not explicitly defined through η, we set them arbitrarily to be positive. We then update Γ ← Γ ∪ Ω k and repeat the process until all cameras and relative signs in C ♯ are known.

Specifically, in each iteration, block OMP computes the inner product of residual and each dictionary atoms left, and picked the atoms corresponding to least inner product value. Then it computes coefficients, associates with chosen atoms, updates residual and repeats until the number of chosen atoms hits the known number K. Block OMP is efficient compared to block FOCUSS, but it succeeds only when the dictionary is sufficient incoherent.</p><p>Block FOCUSS: Serving the same function as block OMP, we adapt FOcal Underdetermined System Solver (FO-CUSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to block FOCUSS to estimate the block sparse approximation. Block FOCUSS and FOCUSS are iterative algorithms solving the ℓ p -norm (p &lt; 1) relaxation of block sparse approximation and regular sparse approximation respectively. The only difference between them is the design of the weight matrix W pk (refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for more detail.) Other than letting W pk = diag(x k−1 ), block FOCUSS updates W pk by the Frobenius norm of each block in x k−1 , which promotes elements in one block to be either all active or all zeros. A regularization technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> serves also in block FOCUSS balancing the approximation error and sparsity of estimated coefficients. Block FOCUSS can often achieve successful block-sparse estimation even in circumstances where block OMP fails. One drawback, however, is its speed as it is dramatically slower than block OMP.</p><p>Initialization: The BSDL factorization itself is inherently an NP-hard problem, therefore it is important to have a good initialization. We relax the BSDL objective using a block ℓ 1 -norm, and solve the relaxed problem by Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Even though the relaxed problem is not convex either, ADMM splits the objective into several small convex sub-problems by introducing several auxiliary variables. A stationary point can be achieved for our ADMM initialization through the judicious choice of parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Experiments</head><p>MATLAB code has been released, check ci2cv.net/paper for further information.</p><p>Compressibility: Our first experiment explores the com-pressibility of real 3D structures from the CMU Motion Capture dataset, where we learned various dictionaries with different dictionary size L and sparsity level K. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> clearly shows that the real 3D structures are modelled well by our compressibility assumption and the coherence of the learned dictionary is being controlled by balancing the approximation error. This result offers a strategy to achieve a unique BSDL factorization at the cost of approximating structures less precisely, which extends the application of our method. Recovering temporal order: In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> we demonstrated that the sparse codes recovered using our method have a natural temporal coherence. This indicates our prior-less approach could be useful for the recovery of the temporal order of 3D structures in future applications. The full analysis of this phenomena is outsize of the scope of this paper.</p><p>High-rank performance: To verify the performance of the proposed method on high-rank and full-rank structures, we conducted experiments with synthetic data where the rank of structures is easily controlled. We utilized Dai et al.'s work 5 as a baseline, which demonstrated that it outperforms other low-rank Sf M methods in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.  The visualization of coefficients. The coefficients of each atoms varies gradually in a shape of Gaussian distribution, which reveals the temporal information of video sequence. It is not used in Sf M, but may be useful for recovering the temporal order of 3D structure in future applications.</p><p>The compressible structure S, with 100 frames and 30 points in each frames, are generated by random dictionary of size L, such that rank(S) = 3L. We repeat the proposed method as well as Dai et al.'s method 50 times for each L from 3 to 12. The results are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. It is seen that our method works perfectly and robustly on structures with any rank, while the low-rank Sf M fails in high-rank and full-rank situations. Moreover, even in lowrank situation, the proposed method outperforms the Dai et al.'s method.</p><p>Noise performance: To evaluate the performance under noise, we repeat the experiments on low-rank structures (with L = 5) at different noise ratios, defined as W −W0 F W0 F . The <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates that our method is sensitive to noise. However, it still works no worse than Dai et al.'s method even at high noise ratios. Practical performance: The proposed method is evaluated on real compressible structures: Motion-4, -5, -6, -7, -8 by Subject-5, and Motion-2, -4 by Subject-1, Motion-5 by Subject-2, Motion-3, -4 by Subject-3 and Motion-13 by Subject-6 in CMU Motion Captures, and a Shark sequence in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The visual evaluation is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>, <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Coherence of learned dictionaries corresponding to the 4 sequences in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7</ref>. The coherence for (d) is too poor to guarantee the uniqueness of BSDL. In addition, it also shows that checking the coherence of learned dictionary beforehand is a good way to predict the performance especially when ground truth are not accessible. which shows that our method obtains impressive results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7a</ref>, 7b, 7c, while it fails in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 7d</ref>. Actually, this failure is able to be forecast even without ground truth. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, the coherence of the learned dictionary for sequence Shark is too poor to guarantee the uniqueness of the BSDL factorization. This insight offers an effective way to predict the reconstructibility of 3D structure when the ground truth structure are not available in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we demonstrated that a compressible 3D structure under weak perspective projection is 2 × 3 blockcompressible. Moreover, if a 2 × 3 unique BSDL factorization can be obtained (of the 2D projections), we showed that the compressible 3D structure and camera motion can be recovered solely by the assumption of compressibility. Superior reconstruction results using our method are achieved in comparison to Dai et al.'s low-rank Sf M method. Impressive results were demonstrated on both synthetic and realworld compressible 3D structures. Finally, we proposed the use of dictionary coherence as a measure of reconstructibility of the projected 3D structures without ground truth -  which adds practical utility of our approach.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>One can view much of the literature of low-rank Sf M drawing heavily upon the fact that one can obtain a solution to the rank constrained factorization problem arg minΠ,B ||W − ΠB|| 2 F , s.t. rank(Π) = 3K (8)through an SVD. Even though the SVD returns a unique solution {Π,B} it is easy to demonstrate that this solution is just one of many possible solutions to W =ΠB = ΠGG −1B = ΠB where the corrective matrix G is any non-singular matrix. The ambiguity of this factorization is problematic for Sf M problems as additional constraints are required to obtain a unique solution.</figDesc></figure>
