<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>How to avoid ambiguity is a challenging problem for conic-based homography estimation. In this paper, we address the problem of homography estimation from two separate ellipses. We find that any two ellipses have a unique common self-polar triangle, which can provide three line correspondences. Furthermore, by investigating the location features of the common self-polar triangle, we show that one vertex of the triangle lies outside of both ellipses, while the other two vertices lies inside the ellipses separately. Accordingly, one more line correspondence can be obtained from the intersections of the conics and the common self-polar triangle. Therefore, four line correspondences can be obtained based on the common self-polar triangle, which can provide enough constraints for the homography estimation. The main contributions in this paper include: (1) A new discovery on the location features of the common self-polar triangle of separate ellipses. (2) A novel approach for homography estimation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In computer vision, homograhy estimation arises in many situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, such as camera calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, 3D reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, visual metrology <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, stereo vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and scene understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. The definition of homograhy described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is that a homography is an invertible mapping from P 2 to itself such that three points lie on the same line if and only if their mapped points are also collinear. The purpose of homography estimation is to find the mapping matrix. In order to recover the matrix, object correspondences are needed. Usually, there are three popular types of objects used in homography estimation, which are points, lines and conics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In this paper, we are interested in conics. Conics are widely used in computer vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> due to two reasons: (1) They are well studied in mathematics and can be represented by a simple matrix.</p><p>(2) They can be detected and estimated robustly by existing mature algorithms. In order to estimate homography from conics, Sugimoto presented a direct conic based homography estimation method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, but it requires seven conic correspondences and it has to solve the problem of ambiguity by conducting back projection. Later, by considering two conics together, Kannala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> presented an algorithm for the minimal case of a pair of conic correspondences, which leads to 4 solutions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Rothwell et al. showed a straightforward approach based on the fact that any two conics always intersect in 4 points (real or complex). Unfortunately, their method has 24 solutions and involves in solving quartic equations. Especially, they addressed the difficulty in matching points from two separate ellipses. They pointed out that there is no way to order the complex points. Even the intersections pairs are complex conjugate pairs, there are still 8 combinations. On this matter, one might use quasi-affine invariant <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> or use absolute signature and limit points <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to distinguish the two complex conjugate pairs. However, It still results in 4 combinations. The reason is that for each pair of complex conjugate points, there are two combinations. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, Chum and Matas found the homograhpy by first order Taylor expansions at two (or more) points from two or more correspondences of local elliptical features. However, the prerequisite of their method is that the metric information of at least two point correspondences should be known. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Conomis recovered the homography by using the pole-polar relationship. Their approach first finds the correspondences using the common poles. Further points are computed by intersecting the polar of the pole with the conic. However, point order is not preserved under pojective transformation. To solve this prob- lem, an affine ordering strategy is proposed, but Chum and Matas <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> pointed out the strategy does not often provide correct correspondence of the poles, which leads to a potentially high number of possible homgoraphy models. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, Wright et al. recovered the homography using four bitangent lines of two ellipses. The problem is the same as using four intersection points. To avid ambiguity, lots of assumptions should be made in their method.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on two separate ellipses (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1</ref>). We find that homography estimation from separate conics has real application. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, Wright et al. used it in forensic blood splatter reconstruction. We try to solve this problem using the common self-polar triangle of conics. Previously, the common self-polar triangle has been used in camera calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> and position relationship discussion <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. So far, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on the location features of the common self-polar triangle of separate ellipses. We find that any two separate ellipses have a unique common self-polar triangle, which can provide three line correspondences. Furthermore, by investigating the location features of the common self-polar triangle, we show that one more line correspondence can be obtained from the intersections of the conics and the common self-polar triangle. In total, four line correspondences can be obtained based on the common self-polar triangle, which can provide enough constraints for the homography estimation. Our approach has three advantages: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> No requirements on the physical information of the patterns and the camera. (2) All computations involved are linear. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> No ambiguity on the solution. To evaluate our approach, we conduct simulate experiments and real experiments, whereby accurate results are achieved.</p><p>Note that our approach is different from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, even we both use the pole-polar relationship. Paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> has not explored the location features of the common poles and they need to carefully order the points when they try to find more point correspondences by intersecting the polar with the conics. In our approach, we explore the location feature of the common self-polar triangle, and four line correspondences can be determined easily, efficiently and without any ambiguity. Our contribution in this paper includes: (1) A new discovery on the location features of the common selfpolar triangle of separate ellipses. (2) A novel approach for homography estimation.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces related notations and theorems. Section 3 discusses the location features of the common self-polar triangle of separate ellipses. Section 4 describes homography estimation method. Section 5 shows the experimental results on synthetic and real data sets. Finally, the concluding remarks are drawn in Section 6.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Homography</head><p>Let (x, x ′ ) be a point correspondence from two images of the same scene plane.

H has 8 degrees of freedom, which can be estimated from four point correspondences(no three points are collinear).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Pole-polar Relationship and Self-polar Triangle</head><p>A point x and conic C define a line l = Cx. The line l is called the polar of x with respect to C, and the point x is the pole of l with respect to C.</p><p>If the poles of a conic form the vertices of a triangle and their respective polars form its opposite sides, it is called a self-polar triangle (see <ref type="figure">Fig.2</ref>). If a self-polar triangle is common to two conics, it is called common self-polar triangle (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.6</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we will use two results from projective geometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> They are:</p><p>Result 1.

If two conics intersect in four distinct points, they have one and only one common self-polar triangle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Location Features of the Common Self-polar Triangle of Separate Ellipses</head><p>Before exploring the location features of the common self-polar triangle of separate ellipses, one proposition is established below. Proposition 1. Two separate ellipses have a unique common self-polar triangle. Proof. Considering intersection points of two separate ellipses, it is easy to find that they have four imaginary intersection points, which fall into two conjugate pairs. Obviously, these four intersection points are distinct. According to the Result 2 in Section 2.2, we can conclude that two separate ellipses have a unique common self-polar triangle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The Common Self-polar Triangle Location</head><p>Based on the fact that two separate ellipses have a unique common self-polar triangle, we investigate the location features and following results are achieved. Property. Let two separate ellipses be C 1 and C 2 , and let points e,f and g be the vertices of their common self-polar triangle. Then one vertex lies outside of both C 1 and C 2 , and the other two vertices lies inside C 1 and C 2 separately.   Proof. Let C be a conic and △ef g be a self-polar triangle of C. Here, we proof that there is one and only one vertex of △ef g lies inside C (see <ref type="figure">Fig.2</ref>).</p><p>We readonly choose one vertex from the self polar triangle and let it be point e. In terms of the definition of self-polar triangle in Section 2.2, we know that the opposite side of the pole is the polar, which means the polar of the pole e is the line going through point f and point g. It is easy to know point e can not lie on the conic. If e lies on the conic, according to Result 1 in Section 2.2, the polar of e will go through e. Then points e, f and g lies on the same line (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.3</ref>), which can not form a triangle.</p><p>Based on the above analysis, we know e either lies inside conic C or outside conic C. If point e lies inside C, according to Result 1 in Section 2.2, the polar of point e has no intersections with coinic C. Consequently, we have that point f and point g lies outside C (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.4</ref>).</p><p>If point e lies outside conic C, the polar of point e has two intersections with conic C. Then there are two cases:</p><p>(1) Points f and g are both inside the conic. (2) One point from points f and g lies inside the conic.</p><p>Let us consider the first case. If point f lies inside the conic, according to Result 1 in Section 2.2, the line (polar) going through points e and g has no intersections with C, which implies point g is outside the conic. Obviously, the first case is not true. Then, it must be the second case (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.5</ref>). Finally, we can conclude that for any self-polar triangle of a conic, there is one and only one vertex of this triangle lies inside the conic. Since △ef g is the common self-polar triangle of C 1 and C 2 , Then △ef g has one and only one vertex lies inside C 1 , and has one and only one vertex lies inside conic C 2 . The third vertex lies outside of both C 1 and C 2 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.6</ref>).</p><p>This Property is very useful. In Section 4, we will derive one important line correspondence from it without any ambiguity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">The Common self-polar Triangle Recovery</head><p>Let point x and line l are the common pole-polar of C 1 and C 2 . The following relationship should be satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x = C 1 −1 l x = λC 2 −1 l,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where λ is a scalar parameter. Subtracting the equations in (6), we get (C 1 −1 − λC 2 −1 )l = 0. By multiplying C 2 on both sides, we obtain the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(C 2 C 1 −1 − λI)l = 0.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>From the equation of (7), we find the common polars for C 1 and C 2 are the eigenvectors of C 2 C 1 −1 . Since we have proved that two separate ellipses have a unique self-polar triangle, the eigenvalues should be distinct.</p><p>Similarly, we can find the vertices of the common selfpolar triangle by computing the eigenvectors of C 2 −1 C 1 .  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Line Correspondences from the Common selfpolar Triangle</head><p>Let the first image of two separate ellipses C 1 and C 2 be C 11 and C 21 . Let the second image be C 12 and C 22 . Let the transformation from the first image to the second image is H. We have:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">C 12 = H −T C 11 H −1 C 22 = H −T C 21 H −1 .<label>(8)</label></formula><p>By computing the product C 22 C 12 −1 , we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C 22 C 12 −1 = (H −T C 21 H −1 )(H −T C 11 H −1 ) −1 = H −T (C 21 C 11 −1 )H T .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Then,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">C 21 C 11 −1 = H T (C 22 C 12 −1 )H −T .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>We find that C 21 C 11 −1 is similar to C 22 C 12 −1 . If λ and l ′ are eigenpairs of C 22 C 12 −1 , according to the property of similarity transformation, λ and H T l ′ are eigenpairs of C 21 C 11 −1 . Based on this observation, we can find three lines correspondences by matching the eigenvalues. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">One More Line Correspondence</head><p>As Section 2 discussed, at least 4 line correspondences are required to estimate the homography. Here, we demonstrate one more line correspondence can be determined without any ambiguity using the Property.</p><p>Let △ef g be the common self-polar triangle of C 11 , C 21 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.7</ref>). Let △e ′ f ′ g ′ be the common self-polar triangle of C 12 , C 22 (See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.8</ref>). According to the Property in Section 3, segment eg has one and only one intersection (point m) with C 11 , and segment f g has one and only one intersection (point n) with C 21 . As we know, collinearity is an invariant under projective transformation, so line mn in first image and line m ′ n ′ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.8</ref>) are correspondence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Homography Estimation Method</head><p>Based on the above analysis, the complete homography estimation algorithm consists of the following steps:</p><p>Step 1: Extract conic C 11 , C 21 , and C 12 , C 22 from two images separately.</p><p>Step 2: Compute the common polars of C 12 and C 22 . Let three eigenpairs be (λ 1 , l ′ 1 ), (λ 2 , l ′ 2 ), and (λ 3 , l ′ 3 ).</p><p>Step 3: Compute (β, l) of C 11 , C 21 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiments and Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Synthetic Data</head><p>In the computer simulations, we first generate two separate ellipses (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig.9</ref> ). Then we set two projective transformation matrix to obtain two images of the separate ellipses. We choose 100 points on each ellipse image, and Gaussian noise with zero-mean and σ standard deviation is added to these image points. Ellipses are fitted to these images using a least squares ellipse fitting algorithm, the common self-polar triangles are computed using the Equation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> in Section 3 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.10</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.11</ref>). We vary the noise  level from 0 pixels to 0.6 pixels. For each noise level, we conduct 1000 independent trials, and the final results are shown in average (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The ground truth (G.T.) is calculated using the rules in Section 2.1.</p><p>From the results, we find that, when there is no noise, the results is the same as the ground truth. When add noise, errors for each parameters is very small.</p><p>In the second experiment, we just add noise on the second image. The first image has no noise. We treat the vertices e, f and g of the common self-polar triangle as fixed points, then calculate the symmetric transfer error (STE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The distance value are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. From the results, we find errors are less than 2 pixels.</p><p>For both experiments, we also implement the algorithm in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Real Scene</head><p>We conduct two real experiments. In the first experiment, we print out two ellipses on one A4 paper. To make it not so ideal, we intentionally place something on the paper. Especially, the "Heart" shape is for the convenience to check the performance of our method. In the second experiment, we place two oval shaped plates on a desk. For these two experiments, real images are taken with a Nikon D300s camera. The image resolution is 2144 × 1424. The images are taken from different viewpoints and the focal lengths are different. The images of ellipses are extracted using Canny's edge detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and ellipses are fitted to these images using a least squares ellipse fitting algorithm. One of the images is chosen as reference (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.12</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.13</ref>). We use our presented approach to compute the homography for each image. Finally, we warp the images back to the reference view. The results are listed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>.</p><p>Note that the considered perspective projections in this paper are quasi-affine with respect to the ellipses and in one case, the homography results may not be accurate. When the scene contains two separate ellipses with a common axis of symmetry, the image plane should not be parallel to the scene when we capture an image, because they have one common pole at infinity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>We have investigated the location features of the common self-polar triangle of separate ellipses. Based on the common self-polar triangle, four line correspondences can be uniquely determined. Our approach is solidly derived from existing theories in projective geometry. All steps involved in our approach are linear and easy to implement. We believe that our method can be easily extended to the case of more than two ellipses. In such case, any two separate ellipses can provide four line correspondences, if there are three or more ellipse correspondences, an overdetermined linear system can be obtained. Therefore, optimization methods can be used to obtain more accurate results. In future work, we will apply this theory into other distributions of two coplanar ellipses or circles.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Two separate ellipses.</figDesc></figure>
