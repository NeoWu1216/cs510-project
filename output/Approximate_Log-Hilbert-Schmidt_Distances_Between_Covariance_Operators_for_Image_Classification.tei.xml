<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Covariance descriptors are a powerful image representation approach in computer vision. In this approach, an image is compactly represented by a covariance matrix encoding correlations between different features extracted from that image. This representation has been demonstrated to work very well in numerous vision tasks, including tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, object detection and classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, and image retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Covariance descriptors, properly regularized if necessary, are symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, which do not form a vector subspace of Euclidean space under the standard matrix addition and scalar multiplication operations, but form a Riemannian manifold. The optimal measure of similarity between covariance descriptors is thus not the Euclidean distance, but a metric that captures this manifold structure. One of the most commonly used Riemannian metrics in the literature is the Log-Euclidean metric developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This is a so-called bi-invariant Riemannian metric under which the manifold is flat, that is having zero curvature. Therefore, it is efficient to compute and can be used to define many positive definite kernels, allowing kernel methods to be applied directly on the manifold. This latter property has been exploited successfully in various recent work in vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. However, a major limitation of covariance matrices is that they only capture linear correlations between input features.</p><p>In this work, we propose to use infinite-dimensional covariance operators as image representations. These are covariance matrices of infinite-dimensional features, which are induced implicitly when a positive definite kernel (K 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>), such as the Gaussian kernel, is applied to the original image features. These covariance operators capture in particular non-linear correlations between the original input features. Each image is then represented by one such covariance operator.</p><p>For tasks such as image classification, we require the notion of distance between image representations, which in this case means the distance between the corresponding covariance operators. It is known that covariance operators, properly regularized, lie on the infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold of positive definite operators <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. On this manifold, the generalization of the Log-Euclidean metric is the Log-Hilbert-Schmidt (Log-HS) metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Having computed the Log-HS distances between the covariance operators, another positive definite kernel (K 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>) can be computed using these distances and used as input to a kernel classifier, e.g. SVM.</p><p>In essence, the above two steps, namely image representation by covariance operators and kernel classification, together make up a two-layer kernel machine. The kernel K 1 in the first layer, with the low-level image features as input, induces covariance operators which capture non-linear correlations between these features. The kernel K 2 in the second layer, with the Log-HS distances between covariance operators as input, allows the application of kernel methods, e.g. SVM, to these operators. The result of this double kernelization process is a more powerful representation that can better capture the expressiveness of the image features by exploiting both the power of kernel methods and the Riemannian manifold setting of covariance operators.</p><p>However, as with many kernel methods, one drawback of the original Log-HS metric formulation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is that it tends not scale well to large datasets.</p><p>To carry out the above kernelization efficiently, we develop the following novel mathematical and computational framework. In this paper, we propose an approximate Log-HS distance formulation. This is done by approximating the implicit infinite-dimensional covariance operators above by explicit finite-dimensional covariance matrices, which are computed using explicit approximate feature maps of the original kernel (K 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). We demonstrate that the approximate Log-HS distance is substantially faster to compute than the true Log-HS distance, with relatively little loss in the performance of the resulting algorithm. The main theoretical contribution of the present work is the mathematical derivation and justification of the approximate Log-HS distance, which goes beyond that for kernel approximation.</p><p>In summary, the novel contributions of our work are the following. Mathematically and computationally,w e present an approximate formulation for the Log-HS distance between covariance operators that is substantially faster to compute than the original formulation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and that is scalable to large datasets, while substantially maintaining an effective discriminating capability. Empirically, we apply our framework to the task of visual object recognition, using eight challenging, publicly available datatsets, ranging from Fish, Virus, and Texture to Scene recognition. On these datasets, our proposed method compares very favorably with previous state of the art methods in terms of classification accuracy and especially in computational efficiency, demonstrating the competitiveness and potential of our framework.</p><p>Related work. Infinite-dimensional covariance operators of low-level features have been applied to the task of image classification recently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which formulated the Log-HS metric, and by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which used the formulation for Bregman divergences proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. While they both work very well, these methods tend to be computationally intensive and not scalable to large datasets. There exists a large literature on large-scale kernel approximation, which focuses on approximating either the feature maps or the kernel matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, but not on the covariance operators. Approximate affine-invariant distances between covariance operators for image classification have recently been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, the affine-invariant distance cannot be used to define positive definite kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and, as we show in Sec. 3, this approximation approach is not scalable to large datasets.</p><p>Organization. We give an overview of the Riemannian distances between finite-dimensional covariance matrices and their generalizations to infinite-dimensional covariance operators in Sec. 2. The core of the paper is Sec. 3, in which we present our approximate Log-HS distance formulation, using two methods for computing approximate feature maps and covariance operators. Empirical results on the task of visual object recognition, using eight different datasets, are reported in Sec. 4. Proofs for all mathematical results are given in the Supplementary Material.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices</head><p>Let n ∈ N be fixed. Covariance matrices of size n × n, properly regularized if necessary, are instances of the set Sym ++ (n) of SPD matrices, which forms a finite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The most commonly encountered Riemannian metric on Sym ++ (n) is the affine-invariant metric, in which the geodesic distance between two SPD matrices A and B is</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">daiE(A, B)=|| log(A −1/2 BA −1/2 )||F ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where F denotes the Frobenius norm, which for A = (a ij ) n i,j=1 is given by ||A|| 2 F = n i,j=1 a 2 ij , and log denotes the principal matrix logarithm. From a practical perspective, the distance (1) tends to be computationally intensive for large scale datasets. This motivated the development of the Log-Euclidean metric framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, in which the geodesic distance between A and B is given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d logE (A, B)=|| log(A) − log(B)||F ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This distance is faster to compute than the distance (1), particularly when computing all pairwise distances on a large set of SPD matrices. Furthermore, the Log-Euclidean metric can be used to define many positive definite kernels, such as the Gaussian kernel, which is not possible using the affine-invariant metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We wish to emphasize that the Log-Euclidean metric is itself a Riemannian metric on Sym ++ (n), a so-called bi-invariant metric, which is a fact not always discussed in recent theoretical work in computer vision, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This metric arises from the commutative Lie group structure of Sym ++ (n), namely A ⊙ B = exp(log(A)+log(B)), introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, where the corresponding geodesic curves and the geodesic distance (2) are derived. In fact, for two commuting matri-ces A and B, the Log-Euclidean and affine-invariant distances are identical, i.e. d logE (A, B)=daiE(A, B). One can see that in Eq. (2), the SPD structure of A and B is encoded via the principal matrix logarithm, which is given by log(A)=U diag(log λ 1 ,...,log λ n )U T , where A = U diag(λ 1 ,...,λ n )U T is the spectral decomposition for A (note that if A has a negative eigenvalue, the principal logarithm is not defined). In contrast, the standard Euclidean distance ||A − B|| F is defined solely in terms of the entries of A − B, without reflecting any structure in A and B. Consequently, even though Sym ++ (n) has zero curvature under the Log-Euclidean metric, the geodesic distance (2) nevertheless captures better the geometry of Sym ++ (n) than the Euclidean distance ||A − B||F . This has also been consistently demonstrated empirically, see e.g <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>The SPD matrices considered in the current work are covariance matrices of features extracted from input data. Specifically, let X⊂R n . Let x =[ x 1 ,...,x m ] be a data matrix sampled from X , where m is the number of observations. In the setting of the current work, there is one such matrix for each image, namely the matrix of low-level features sampled at (a subset of) the pixels in the image. Each image is then represented by the n × n covariance matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Cx = 1 m xJmx T : R n → R n ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where Jm is the centering matrix, defined by Jm = Im − 1 m 1m1 T m with 1m =(1,...,1) T ∈ R m . In practice, Cx is generally only positive semi-definite and thus to apply the Riemannian structure of Sym ++ (n), it is often necessary to consider the regularized version (Cx + γIn) for some γ&gt;0. For two covariance matrices Cx and Cy, we therefore consider the distance between the regularized versions (Cx + γI) and (Cy + μI), given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">d logE = || log(Cx + γIn) − log(Cy + μIn)||F ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>for some regularization parameters γ&gt;0, μ&gt;0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Infinite-dimensional covariance operators</head><p>The covariance matrix Cx only measures the linear correlations between the features in the input data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Approximate Log-HS Distance</head><p>While kernel methods are powerful in learning nonlinear structures in data, they tend not to scale well, in terms of computational complexity, to large datasets, which are common in vision problems such as object recognition and fine-grained categorization. In the typical kernel learning setting, the feature map Φ is high-dimensional (and often infinite-dimensional, as in the case of the Gaussian kernel) and thus is only used implicitly. Instead, exact kernel methods carry out computations using Gram matrices and thus their computational complexities depend on the sizes of the Gram matrices, which become very large for large datasets.</p><p>A commonly used approach that has emerged recently to reduce the computational cost of kernel methods is to compute an explicit approximate feature mapΦD : X→ R D , where D is finite and D&lt; &lt;dim(H), so that</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Φ D (x),ΦD(y) R D =KD(x, y) ≈ K(x, y), with (9) lim D→∞K D (x, y)=K(x, y) ∀(x, y) ∈X×X.<label>(10)</label></formula><p>The approximate feature mapΦD is then used directly in the learning algorithms instead of the Gram matrices.</p><p>In our setting, we use the approximate feature maps to compute the corresponding finite-dimensional approximate covariance operators. The Log-Euclidean distance between the approximate operators is then used as the approximate version of Log-HS distance between the infinitedimensional covariance operators.

The mathematical justification for the latter goes beyond that for kernel approximation and is the main theoretical contribution of this work.</p><p>In fact, as we show in Theorems 1 and 2 below, Eq. (10), which guarantees the convergence of the approximate kernel value to the true kernel value, is not sufficient to guarantee the convergence of the approximate Log-HS distance to the true Log-HS distance as D →∞ . This convergence is non-trivial and requires further assumptions, which are practically realizable.</p><p>Approximate covariance operator and approximate Log-HS distance. With the approximate feature map ΦD, we have the corresponding data matrixΦ</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">D (x)= [Φ D (x 1 ),...,Φ D (x m )]</formula><p>of size D × m, and the approximate covariance operator has the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">CΦ D (x) = 1 mΦ D (x)JmΦD(x) T : R D → R D ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>which is a matrix of size D × D, instead of the potentially infinite matrix C Φ(x) of size dim(H) × dim(H).</p><p>We then consider the following as an approximate version of the Log-HS distance given in Formula <ref type="formula">(8)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">log CΦ D (x) + γID − log CΦ D (y) + μID F .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>Key theoretical question.

It turns out that in general, this is not possible. This is because the infinite-dimensional Log-HS distance is generally not obtainable as a limit of the finite-dimensional Log-Euclidean distance as the dimension approaches infinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.

In this work, we employ two methods for computing the approximate feature mapΦ D , namely Random Fourier features <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and Quasi-random Fourier features <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, presented in the following section.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Computational complexity</head><p>We present here the computational analysis of the proposed approximation in Eq.

At first glance, the computational complexity for the approximate affine-invariant distance in Eq. (23), which consists of a matrix square root and inversion, two matrix multiplications and an SVD, is also O(D 3 ). However, computationally, the key difference between Eq. (12) and Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(23)</ref>is that in Eq. We also note that for N pairs of data matrices, the computational complexity of the exact Log-HS formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and the RKHS Bregman divergences <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is of order O(N 2 m 3 ). Thus for D&lt;mand N large, the approximate Log-HS formulation will be much more efficient to compute than both the exact Log-HS and the RKHS Bregman divergences (see the actual running time comparison between the approximate and exact Log-HS formulations in the experiments below). Algorithm 1: Summary of the proposed method.</p><p>Further comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the authors proposed two methods: (i) Nearest Neighbor using effectively the approximate affine-invariant distance given in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> with γ = μ =0and (ii) the CDL algorithm using the representation log(CΦ D (x) ). Both of these methods require the assumption that CΦ D (x) is positive definite, which is never guaranteed. In fact, when D&gt;m , CΦ D (x) is always rankdeficient and neither its inverse nor log can be computed. Thus neither the CDL nor the approximate affine-invariant distance can be used. Theoretically, since it does not employ any regularization, the approximate affine-invariant distance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> will not approach the exact affine-invariant distance ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>) for large D, which always requires regularization (see Sec. 2.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experimental results</head><p>In this section, we show the performance of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches on eight image classification datasets. In all the datasets, we used the same features and experimental protocols of the compared state-of-the-art approaches (see details below). The following methods were evaluated: LogE, using the Log-Euclidean metric, Stein, using the Stein (also called Jensen-Bregman LogDet) divergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Log-HS, using the Log-HS metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> induced by the Gaussian kernel (K 1 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, but only on the Fish dataset, see below), and Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS induced by the Gaussian kernel, using the proposed random Fourier and Quasi-random Fourier approximation methods in Sec. 3, respectively. For a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, we set the approximate feature dimension D = 200 (Eq. 20) for Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS (more details below). Except with Stein, all experiments used LIBSVM <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for classification, with the Gaussian kernel defined on top of the corresponding metric (K 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). For Stein, since the corresponding Gaussian kernel is generally not guaranteed to be positive definite <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we used the Nearest Neighbor approach as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. We also compared the above methods with CDL <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, one of the state-of-the-art approaches in covariance-based learning. On the Fish dataset, we also carried out experiments with the Euclidean (E) and Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) metrics to demonstrate the advantage of the Riemannian geometric framework 1 . The performance is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy (more details below).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Datasets</head><p>The Fish recognition dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> contains 27, 370 fish images acquired from live video. There are altogether 23 classes of fish and the number of images per class ranges from 21 to 12, 112, with a mean resolution of 150 × 120 pixels. The significant variations in color, pose and illumination inside each class make this dataset very challenging. We conducted two different experiments on this dataset, using the R,G,B features from Eq. (24), as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The first experiment (named Exp1) is a small scale experiment which used the same protocol and the 10 splits provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, consisting altogether of 345 images, divided in 115 images for training (5 per class) and 230 images for testing (10 per class) . We analyzed the performances of Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS with respect to the original Log-HS metric formulation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Furthermore, we compared the computational cost and running time of the two approximate versions with respect to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. In the second experiment (named Exp2), the entire Fish dataset was used to show the scalability of the proposed method. We note that this experiment was not carried out using the exact Log-HS metric due to its high computational cost in terms of memory and speed. In this case, since the number of testing samples are different between the classes, the classification performance is evaluated using the Average Precision (AP) measure, a standard metric used by the PASCAL challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The Virus Classification dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> contains 15 different virus classes. Each class has 100 images of size 41 × 41. For this dataset, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we employed the 25-dimensional feature vector consisting of the intensity, 4 gradients, and 20 Gabor filters in Eq. (24)at4 orientations and 5 scales. We used the 10 splits provided by the authors in a leave-one-out manner, i.e. 9 splits for training and 1 split as query, repeating the procedure 10 times.</p><p>The KTH-TIPS2b Material dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> contains images of 11 materials captured under 4 illuminations, in 3 poses and at 9 scales, giving 108 images for each sample in a category, with 4 samples per material. For each category, we trained on 3 samples and tested on the remaining sample. For this dataset, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we extracted the 23-dimensional feature consisting of the R,G,B values and 20 Gabor filters in Eq. (24)at4 orientations and 5 scales.</p><p>The Texture dataset for our experiments was created by combining 111 texture images of the Brodatz dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and 61 of the CURET dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, as done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Unfortunately, we were not able to reproduce the experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> since the exact protocols, i.e. the number of patches extracted from each image and the number of training/testing images, were not specified. We therefore carried out a similar experiment by extracting 150 patches of size 20 × 20 from each image, taking 140 as training and 10 as testing, repeating the entire procedure 10 times. For this dataset, we extracted the 5-dimensional feature vector [x, y, I, |I x |, |I y |] as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>For person re-identification, we used two sequences of the ETHZ dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. SEQ. #1 contains 83 pedestrians in 4, 857 images. SEQ. #2 contains 35 pedestrians in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">936</ref> images. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we used 10 images from each subject for training and the rest for testing. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we extracted the 17-dimensional feature vector consisting of [x, y, R, G, B] and the first-and second-order color derivatives, i.e. [| ∂r ∂x |, | ∂r ∂y |, | ∂ 2 r ∂x 2 |, | ∂ 2 r ∂y 2 |], for r = R, G, B. The performance was evaluated using the Average Precision metric.</p><p>The UIUC dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> contains 18 different material categories collected in the wild, with a total of 216 images. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we extracted the 19-dimensional vector consisting of 3 colors, 4 gradients, and 12 Gabor filters in Eq.(24)at4 orientations and 3 scales. As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we split the database into training and test sets by randomly assigning half of the images of each class to the training set and testing on the rest. This process was repeated 10 times.</p><p>The TinyGraz03 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> contains 1148 indoor and outdoor scenes with an image resolution of 32 × 32 pixels. The images are divided in 20 classes with at least 40 samples per class. We used the recommended train/test split provided by the authors. For this dataset, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, at each pixel we extracted the 7-dimensional feature vector [|I x |, |I y |, |I xx |, |I yy |,R,G,B] from Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. This dataset is highly challenging and the correct recognition rate achieved by humans is only 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>The ETH80 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> contains images of eight object categories: apples, cows, cups, dogs, horses, pears, tomatoes, and cars. Each category includes ten object subcategories (e.g. various dogs) in 41 orientations, resulting in 410 images per category. We randomly chose 21 images for training and the rest for testing, repeating the procedure 10 times. For this dataset, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, at each pixel we extracted the 5-dimensional feature vector [x, y, I(x, y), |I x |, |I y |] from Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Analysis and discussion of results</head><p>Classification performance compared with exact Log-HS metric. First of all, we ran a comparative experiment on a subset of the Fish dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, to analyze the performances of the Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS formulations with respect to the original Log-HS formulation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. For this dataset, we show results obtained using R,G,B features as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> with all methods. Column two of Tab.1 shows the mean and standard deviation values for the classification accuracies computed over all 10 random splits. The first important observation we note is that Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS gave results (first and second rows) which are comparable with those using the Log-HS metric and substantially better than other methods, namely LogE, Stein, and CDL. Furthermore, the Riemannian distance LogE substantially outperforms the Euclidean distance E, and similarly LogHS, Approx LogHS, and QApprox LogHS all outperform the Hilbert-Schmidt distance HS. This clearly demonstrates the advantage of the Riemannian geometric framework.</p><p>Running time compared with exact Log-HS metric. Most importantly, Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS incur much smaller computation costs compared to Log-HS. In fact, using MATLAB on an Intel Xeon E5-2650, 2.60 GHz PC, we obtained a speed up of 30× with QApprox LogHS (Train: 6.7sec. Test: 18sec.) and more than 50× with Approx LogHS (Train: <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. Best results obtained on seven different datasets in terms of classification accuracy. The first two rows represent the proposed method using the two-layer kernel machine using Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS with Gaussian SVM. The last row represents the state-of-the-art results on each dataset.</p><p>With this computational speed-up, we next ran a second experiment (third column) using the whole Fish dataset. The classification accuracy shows an improvement of 10% and 11.5% for Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS, respectively, with respect to LogE and an improvement of 15.4% and 16.9% with respect to the Stein divergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Comparison against other state of the art (SoA) methods. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the results of the proposed method (first two rows) on seven different datasets in comparison with the respective state-of-the-art results. The best result <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> reported for the Virus dataset is an accuracy of 82.5% (last row). Our classification accuracy is slightly lower than this result but it outperforms all the other competitors (LogE, Stein and CDL,by9.6%, 31.8%, and 12%, respectively). Our results on the KTH-TIPS2b Material dataset improves the state of the art <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>by3.5% (third column). The accuracy of the proposed method on the Texture dataset (forth column) is 23.1% higher of the best of the other competitors. The fifth and sixth columns of <ref type="table">Table  2</ref> report the results on two sequences of the ETHZRe-ID dataset. In this case, we obtained an improvement of 1.8% over the state-of-the-art <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Regarding the UIUC and the TinyGraz03 datasets, the improvement over the previous results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, is 2.7% and 3%, respectively. Our method outperforms the recent state of the art <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> also on the ETH80 dataset with an improvement of 11.4%.</p><p>These improvements in classification accuracies all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. More importantly, we emphasize that our approximate Log-HS formulations are much more computationally efficient than both the RKHS Bregman divergences in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the approximate affine-invariant distance used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, as discussed in Sec. 3.3.</p><p>Increasing the approximate feature dimension.W e also carried out a set of experiments to show that the classification accuracy improves when increasing the approximate feature dimension D in Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, as expected. We tested this on the TinyGraz03 dataset, with D = 200, 400, 1000, with the results reported in Tab. 3. However, as also expected,  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Results on the TinyGraz03 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> with increasing values of the approximate feature dimension D. We also reported the training time in seconds below each accuracy.</p><p>the improvement in classification accuracy comes at a larger computational cost. In fact, the training time for D = 1000 is 63 and 48 times slower than D = 200 for Approx LogHS and QApprox LogHS, respectively. In other words, there is a very large computational speed up factor from D = 1000 to D = 200 with a very low drop in accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion, discussion, and future work</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a novel mathematical and computational framework for visual object recognition using infinite-dimensional covariance operators of image features, in the paradigm of kernel methods and Riemannian geometry. Our approximate Log-HS distance formulation is substantially faster to compute than the original Log-HS, with relatively little loss in classification accuracy, and is scalable to large datasets. Empirically, our framework compares very favorably with previous state of the art methods in terms of classification accuracy and especially in computational complexity.</p><p>As ongoing work, we are investigating the direction of replacing low-level hand-crafted features used in our current experiments with feature learning techniques, such as convolutional networks. Preliminary experiments on the Fish dataset show that we obtain an improvement of approximately 15% by using convolutional features in combination with the proposed approximate Log-HS distance formulation. We will report the full results in a future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Model of the proposed framework</figDesc></figure>
