<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The uncalibrated photometric stereo problem for non-Lambertian surfaces is challenging because of the large number of unknowns and its ill-posed nature stemming from unknown reflectance functions. We propose a model that represents various isotropic reflectance functions by using the principal components of items in a dataset, and formulate the uncalibrated photometric stereo as a regression problem. We then solve it by stepwise optimization utilizing principal components in order of their eigenvalues. We have also developed two techniques that lead to convergence and highly accurate reconstruction, namely (1) a coarse-to-fine approach with normal grouping, and (2) a randomized multipoint search. Our experimental results with synthetic data showed that our method significantly outperformed previous methods. We also evaluated the algorithm in terms of real image data, where it gave good reconstruction results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Photometric stereo is a technique for shape estimation from the appearance of an object illuminated by various light sources and captured by a fixed camera. The original photometric stereo technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref>, proposed by Woodham, is able to treat only Lambertian targets and assumes that lighting positions are calibrated. Various types of extensions have been proposed such as the application to non-Lambertian objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">10]</ref>, overcoming the necessity for lighting calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16]</ref>, adopting the environment of the perspective projection model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20]</ref>, and assuming near point lighting sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">35]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we tackle uncalibrated photometric stereo for non-Lambertian reflection. Because the lighting directions and reflectance functions are involved as unknown parameters, this problem setting is quite challenging, with few studies reported to date. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15]</ref>, it is assumed that the similarity of the intensity profiles is in proportion to one of the normal orientations, which enables this problem to be solved up to a binary convex/concave ambiguity. Some methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17]</ref> enforce the symmetry of isotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) about a half vector between a camera and lighting direction, which is observed in many materials. The most recent method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref> utilizes a reference data and formulates the uncalibrated photometric stereo as the matching problem. While these existing methods work well in some conditions, they strongly depend on various assumptions such as half-vector symmetry, good initial estimation, and particular lighting distribution, and they fail when these assumptions do not hold.</p><p>It is a common technique in calibrated photometric stereo to represent specularity and retroreflection by parametric models such as the biquadratic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref> and bivariate Bernstein polynomials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref>. Although they can be effective with known lighting directions, they are difficult to apply to uncalibrated cases because the solution space expands enormously with the number of unknowns.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a new method solving uncalibrated non-Lambertian photometric stereo, that formulates a regression problem using an image formation model based on principal component analysis (PCA). This is the first work that incorporates the image formation model into uncalibarated photometric stereo for general isotropic surfaces to our best knowledge. This method estimates the surface normals, lighting vectors, and reflectance properties simultaneously and accurately. We apply PCA to various BRDFs in a database and represent any unknown BRDF as a linear combination of principal components as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>, thereby formulating the uncalibrated photometric stereo as a regression problem. We propose this strategy for two main reasons. First, we can approximate various kinds of materials well by using the unique model. Second, although it also has unknowns of the same number of basis functions, this approach enables stepwise optimization. We can roughly estimate surface normals, lightings, and basis coefficients by using only a few principal components and then refine the estimations using more basis functions. By using this strategy, we can reduce the search space appropriately thanks to the property that principal components are ranked according to the order of their influence. In order to solve the minimizing problem, we have to deal with two difficulties: (1) discreteness, and (2) strong nonlinearity. For problem (1), we prepare an additional parametric model separate from the evaluation of the reprojection error and carry out an approximate gradient estimation. For problem (2), we propose a strategy based on a coarse-to-fine approach and multipoint searching. In experiments, we compare our proposal with recent techniques and our method shows stateof-the-art performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>The original photometric stereo <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref> assumes known directional lighting and Lambertian reflectance, which is one of the simplest BRDF models. Subsequent methods have aimed at expanding photometric stereo for more complicated scenes and photographing environments.</p><p>Photometric stereo targeting a non-Lambertian object is challenging because its reflectance properties are too complicated and variable for accurate representation by a unique parametric model. Some methods treat non-Lambertian effects as outliers and remove them using techniques such as sparse regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref>, rank minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>, and colorspace rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[18]</ref>. Although these methods are not capable of treating nonsparse effects such as rough specularity, they can remove sharp specularity, digital noise, calibration error, inter-reflections, and other obstacles. Other methods formulate parametric models that can represent specularity, such as the Torrance-Sparrow model <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9]</ref>, the biquadratic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref>, and bivariate Bernstein polynomials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref>. These flexible models are capable of treating various reflections such as rough specularity or retroreflection.</p><p>Photometric stereo with uncalibrated lighting is also a challenging problem. Most of the methods proposed so far assume Lambertian surfaces because of their simplicity. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>, it was shown that uncalibrated photometric stereo for a Lambertian object can be solved up to the generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[6]</ref> by enforcing integrability. Many subsequent methods have tackled the problem of GBR disambiguation, such as using color profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref>, local maxima <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref>, and entropy minimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Fewer methods exist for uncalibrated photometric stereo with non-Lambertian objects. Instead of modeling BRDF functions parametrically, they use other information such as intensity profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15]</ref>, attached shadow <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref>, and the symmetry of isotropic BRDFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref>  Our proposal method utilizes a BRDF dataset as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref> but in an entirely different way. It is based on a representation of a BRDF by using principal components of items in a dataset as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref> conducts a dense measurement and constructs a data-driven BRDF model. They also apply PCA to the measured BRDFs in an effort to analyse BRDFs. We utilize this semi-parametric model for photometric stereo and formulate a regression problem, and recover surface normals by solving it. Our contributions are listed below.</p><p>1. We propose a new method solving uncalibrated non-Lambertian photometric stereo, that utilizes PCA and formulates a regression problem. 2. We propose an algorithm to enhance the global convergence of discrete and highly nonlinear minimization problems. 3. We expand our method for (1) calibrated photometric stereo and (2) uncalibrated photometric stereo for a target with spatially varying reflectance. 4. In our experiments we show that our proposal outperforms the state-of-the art methods for both uncalibrated and calibrated photometric stereo for non-Lambertian BRDFs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Photometric Stereo Based on PCA</head><p>In this section, we formulate the uncalibrated photometric stereo as a regression problem based on PCA. Our problem setting is described as follows:</p><p>1. The positions of the camera and the object are fixed across all images. We define the target's position as the origin and the camera direction as the z-axis of the orthogonal coordinates (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Although isotropic BRDFs depend on the camera direction v in addition to surface normals and lighting vectors, we treat v as a known fixed vector ([0, 0, 1] T ) and therefore do not specify it in the equations in this paper. 2. The object is illuminated by unknown and varying light sources. These lightings are directional. 3. The camera view is orthographic and the radiometric response function is linear.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Histograms of intensity values (not including the shadow) and appearances of (a) original and (b) modified images respectively (in this example we used alum-bronz BRDF data in the MERL database <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>, and set α = 0.2). We can observe that the bias of the intensities is reduced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">4</ref>. In the preprocessing phase, we take</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">I = I α ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where I means an observation intensity and α (0&lt;α&lt; 1) is a correction factor that reduces the variance of intensity values (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) . We adopt it because our method does not work well with the original intensity values. This is because of the large differences in order between intensities in the diffuse and specular regions.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>, Matusik used the natural logarithm before applying PCA to the measured BRDFs and magnified the importance of the diffusion, for the same reason. Our preprocessing has a similar effect to the logarithmic approach but is more useful because it can be applied after normalizing the pixel values. Hereafter, we will describe the modified intensities simply as I or "intensities."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Linear Combination Representation of Image Formation Model Based on PCA</head><p>The factor that complicates photometric stereo, regardless of whether lighting sources are calibrated or not, is that the reflectance of the target material is unknown. Therefore, the reprojection error cannot be defined uniquely. To overcome this ill-posedness we model the image formation model (I = f (n, l) = ρ(n, l)n T l, where ρ is a BRDF, n is a surface normal vector, and l is a lighting vector. n and l are normalized.) as a linear combination of basis functions generated by applying PCA to MERL database <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>. To apply PCA, which requires a discrete data structure, we prepare intensity set vectors for each material in the dataset. These are normalized column vectors whose elements are intensities parameterized by θ n , θ l , and φ d (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> for these parameters).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F b ≜      I b (θ 0 n , θ 0 l , φi 0 ) I b (θ 0 n , θ 0 l , φ 1 d ) . . . I b (θ Θn−1 n , θ Θ l −1 l , φ Φ d −1 d )      / max(I b (θ n , θ l , φ d )),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where b is a BRDF index and I b (θ n , θ l , φ d ) is an intensity given by these parameters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">(θ 0 n , θ 0 l , φ 0 d ), (θ 0 n , θ 0 l , φ 1 d ), . . ., (θ Θn−1 n , θ Θ l −1 l , φ Φ d −1 d</formula><p>) are the sampling points, and Θ n , Θ l , Φ d are the numbers of samples for each parameter. In other words, the length of F b is Θ n ·Θ l ·Φ d . Then, by applying PCA to vectors of F 0 , F 1 , . . . , F B−1 we obtain B basis vectors that are of the same form as F b . We represent them as U 0 , U 1 , . . . , U B−1 , where U 0 is an average of F b , and U 1 , . . . , U B−1 are the principal components in descending order of eigenvalue. We use the first M bases, and construct the model as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f (n, l) = M −1 ∑ m=0 a m u m (n, l),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where a m (m = 0, 1, . . . , M −1) are the coefficients that determine the reflection properties and u m (n, l) is a function which returns the element of U m corresponding to the nearest sampling points from (θ n , θ l , φ d ). Under the assumption that any isotropic reflectance is represented well by this linear combination model, we formulate the uncalibrated photometric stereo problem as an energy minimization:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min N ,L,aM E M ≜ N −1 ∑ i=0 L−1 ∑ j=0 M −1 ∑ m=0 a m u m (n i , l j ) − I i,j 2 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where N , L, and a M denote sets of N surface normals, L lighting vectors, and M basis coefficients, respectively. I i,j is an intensity value given by the i-th surface normal n i and the j-th lighting vector l j . Note that, although the result of minimizing Eq. (4) remains a rotation/flip ambiguity, it can be easily solved up to a convex/concave ambiguity by enforcing an integrability constraint. The detail about this disambiguation is described in our supplementary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Approximating Gradient with a Piecewise Hyperplane Function</head><p>We minimize Eq. (4) by a gradient descent method that uses a Jacobian matrix. Because f is a discrete function, and therefore ∂f /∂n and ∂f /∂l cannot be calculated directly, we construct a parametric image formation modelf in addition to f and calculate the Jacobian part corresponding to n and l by differentiatingf instead of f to approximate the Jacobian.</p><p>We model a piecewise linear functionũ(n, l) parameterized by n T l, l T v, n T v and we obtain this hyperplane by parameter fitting, using only the first basis function u 0 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">u 0 (n, l) ≈ũ(n, l) = An T l + Bl T v + Cn T v + D,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Using this hyperplane we approximate as f (n, l) ≈ a 0 u 0 (n, l) ≈ a 0ũ (n, l) ≜f (n, l),  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Our piecewise hyperplane model is fitted to collections of {n T l, l T v, n T v, u 0 (n, l)} in each region. For visualization, we plotted for two cases: (a) n T v is fixed, but n T l and l T v vary. (b) l T v is fixed, but n T l and n T v vary. In this case, D nl = D lv = D nv = 3.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">n T v 2/Dnv u 0 (n, l) 2/Dnl n T l 1 0 1/Dnl (b) l T v is fixed to 0.5</formula><p>thereby performing the Jacobian approximation. This is because the influence of u 0 covers most of the approximation of Eq. (3), and u 0 is monotonic for n T l, l T v, n T v, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Although this is a coarse approximation, because overfitting can be avoided with this low dimensionality, the gradient direction estimate is unlikely to be mistaken.</p><p>We divide the domains of each parameter (n T l, l T v, n T v) into D nl , D lv , D nv segments, respectively. The partitions of each parameter domain are set to d nl /D nl (d nl =1, . . . , D nl −1), d lv /D lv (d lv =1, . . . , D lv −1), and d nv /D nv (d nv =1, . . . , D nv −1). In every combination of segments we approximate u 0 with a hyperplane by linear least-squares. In other words, we construct D nl · D lv · D nv hyperplanes. The coefficients A, B, and C are fitted in every region and stored beforehand. They are just looked up and utilized to the Jacobian approximation.</p><p>Note that, for the purpose of enforcing a unit-size constraint on surface normals and lighting vectors, we optimize them in the gradient space (p, q), defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(p n,i , q n,i )= ( n x,i n z,i , n y,i n z,i ) , (p l,j , q l,j )= ( l x,j l z,j , l y,j l z,j ) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where n x,i , n y,i , n z,i and l x,j , l y,j , l z,j are the three elements of the i-th normal vector n i and the j-th lighting vector l j , respectively.</p><p>Then, a row of the Jacobian corresponding to e i,j ≜ f (n i , l j ) − I i,j of Eq. (4) comprises</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">[ ∂e i,j ∂p n,i , ∂e i,j ∂q n,i ] ≈ a 0 ∂ũ ∂n i [ ∂n i ∂p n,i ∂n i ∂q n,i ]<label>(7)</label></formula><p>= a 0</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">( A nl,lv,nv l T j + C nl,lv,nv v T ) [ ∂n i ∂p n,i ∂n i ∂q n,i ] , [ ∂e i,j ∂p l,j , ∂e i,j ∂q l,j ] ≈ a 0 ∂ũ ∂l j [ ∂l j ∂p l,j ∂l j ∂q l,j ] (8) = a 0 ( A nl,lv,nv n T i + B nl,lv,nv v T ) [ ∂l j ∂p l,j ∂l j ∂q l,j ] , [ ∂e i,j ∂a 0 , . . . , ∂e i,j ∂a M −1 ] =[u 0 (n i , l j ), . . . , u M −1 (n i , l j )] ,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where A nl,lv,nv , B nl,lv,nv , C nl,lv,nv are the coefficients looked up depending on the domain of the current estimation. Because the regions corresponding to n T l ≤ 0 and 0 &lt; n T l ≤ 1/D nl are included in the same domains, ∂ũ/∂n and ∂ũ/∂l have nonzero values even when n T l is estimated as negative, which is an advantage of this method of calculation. We optimize Eq. (4) by using the Levenberg-Marquardt method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref>. Although our method even works well from the initial surface normals which all are set as n = [0, 0, 1] T by combining the methods presented in Sections 3 and 4, we initialize the surface normals by using the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref> for more robust estimation. We also initialize the lighting vectors to l j = [0, 0, 1] T (j = 0, 1, . . . , L − 1) and the basis coefficients to a M = [1, 0, . . . , 0] T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Refinement by Increasing the Number of Basis Functions</head><p>As the number of basis functions increases, Eq. (3) becomes a good approximation of the image formation model but it has strong nonlinearity and the optimization is therefore likely to get stuck in local minima. We therefore propose to use stepwise optimization. We first find an intermediate solution by minimizing Eq. (4) with M =1 (only u 0 is being used). We then use the coarsely estimated surface normals, lightings, and a 0 as the next starting point to solve Eq. (4) with M =2. In this way, we can refine the estimation sequentially while adding basis functions one at a time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Optimization</head><p>Although we can obtain good estimation by using the method presented in Section 3, the method can suffer from local-minima problems, depending on the initial estimation or various parameter values. To obtain robust and accurate estimation, we propose a simple but very powerful strategy that enhances convergence to the better solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Coarse-to-fine Using Normal Grouping</head><p>We can use a coarse-to-fine approach, given that it can be redundant and costly to use all terms of Eq. (4) in a onetime optimization. To prune out similar surface normals, we adopt the normal grouping technique proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref> at the beginning of the minimization process. This reduction in the number of unknowns gives improved convergence and shorter computational time, which enhances the multipoint search described in Section 4.2. We first perform K-means clustering using the correlations of the intensity profiles, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref>, and select the nearest pixels to the center of each cluster. Second, we estimate the normals of selected points and lighting vectors by minimizing Eq. (4), and set the surface normals that were not selected at the normal grouping step to the estimated normal vectors of the representative points of each cluster. Third, we refine all the normal vectors with lighting vectors fixed by the results of the second step. Finally, we refine all the normals and lighting vectors simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Randomized Multipoint Search</head><p>In addition to the stepwise refinement approach, we adopt a multipoint search strategy in each optimization process <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4)</ref>. At the beginning of the minimization with M basis functions, we scatter P starting points by randomly shifting all the normals and lighting vectors that have been estimated provisionally. We then carry out the optimization from each starting point and choose the result that has the lowest energy as the revised estimation. In the randomshifting process, the i-th normal vector of the p-th starting point n p,M i is calculated as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">n p,M i = vec (θ M −1 n,i + R(r θn ),φ M −1 n,i + R(r φn ) )</formula><p>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(10)</ref> where vec (θ, φ) denotes a three-dimensional normalized vector whose elevation angle and azimuth angle are θ and φ, respectively.θM −1 n,i andφM −1 n,i are the elevation and azimuth angles of the i-th normal vector which was chosen in the optimization with M − 1 basis functions, and R(r) is an uniform random number whose range is [−r, r]. The lighting vector setup is performed similarly. To guarantee at least one result for the optimization at M with energy less than the best estimation at M − 1, we set one starting point to be the same as the best estimation at M − 1.</p><p>This strategy increases the computational cost in proportion to the number of initial points, and the number of points required increases with the solution space of the problem. Therefore, this strategy works harmoniously with the normal-grouping method and they can be adopted together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Extension of Our Method</head><p>Calibrated Photometric Stereo One of the advantages of our method is that it is capable of solving photometric stereo problems in cases where the lighting sources are calibrated simply by fixing the lighting vectors of Eq. (4) to the true directions. Whereas it is possible to estimate the surface normals either simultaneously or per pixel, the former approach works well only when the target object has uniform reflectance. ... <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: When adding the next basis function, we scatter multiple initial points, and perform an optimization from each point. We then simply select the result with the lowest energy.</p><p>The pixelwise calibrated photometric stereo problem is solved by optimizing:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">min n,aM E cali M ≜ L−1 ∑ j=0 M −1 ∑ m=0 a m u m (n, l j ) − I j 2 ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where I j is the j-th intensity value of the target pixel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncalibrated Photometric Stereo for Spatially Varying Reflectance</head><p>The weak aspect of our method is that the model in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(3)</ref> is based on the assumption that the target has uniform reflectance. To address this point, we combine the albedo grouping introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref> and Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(11)</ref>. First, we perform the albedo grouping and select a cluster for which most pixels are included, to collect pixels having the same reflectance. Second, we solve Eq. (4) only for selected pixels and lighting vectors by using the methods presented in Sections 3 and 4. Third, the remaining pixels are estimated by optimizing Eq. (11) using the estimated lighting vectors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Experimental Results</head><p>In this section, we evaluate our proposal and compare it with previous methods using both synthetic and realimage data. All experiments were performed on an Intel Xeon X5650 (2.67 GHz) machine with 64 GB RAM and were implemented in MATLAB. For the synthetic experiments, we generated 32-bit high-dynamic-range images of Stanford bunny (96 × 96) with foreground masks rendered by using different BRDFs and lighting sources placed at random. In Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 we performed the experiments with 45 images. The correction factor α in Eq. (1) was determined manually and set as 0.2. In Eq. (2), we set the number of samples for each parameter as Θ n =Θ l =91, Φ d =181, and defined the sampling points as (θ r n , θ s l , φ t d ) = (r, s, t) (degrees). The source material used for the PCA was all 100 items in the MERL dataset in all experiments except as described in Section 6.4, and we used ten basis functions for the approximation Eq. (3) in all experiments except as described in Section 6.2. The number of division for each parameter of the hyperplane (Section 3.2) were D nl =D lv =D nv =3. In Eq. (10) we set the range of scattering searching points to r θn =r φn =r θ l =r φ l =1 • in all experiments except as described in Section 6.5. In Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.5 we use five common parametric BRDF models: Cook-Torrance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[7]</ref>, Ward <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref> , Lafortune <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref>, Ashikhmin-Shirley <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[4]</ref>, and Oren-Nayar [23] 1 . In Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 we tested our method eight times for each condition and used the averages (we also recorded the standard deviations, worst scores, and best scores for some cases).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.">Parameter Test: The Number of Clusters for the Normal Grouping and Search Points</head><p>We performed an experiment to evaluate differences in the accuracy of the final results and the computational time for various numbers of normal clusters K (see Section 4.1) and searching points P (see Section 4.2). For each combination of K and P , we tested our method eight times with each BRDF and took the average of these 40 mean angular errors (MAEs) and computational times (5 BRDF models × 8 trials gives 40 results). The MAE means the average of errors between ground-truth normal maps and the recovered ones. Here, the computational time includes the times for both the normal grouping and the minimization, but does not include preparing the initial estimation by using the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The experimental results are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. Note that the right-hand-side ends of both contour graphs correspond to the results without the normal grouping. It is of interest that the MAE decreases with K when K is relatively large, even with P =1. We conjecture that the normal grouping results in a reduction of not only the computational time but also the solution space. On the other hand, the accuracy is poor when K is small because of the overfitting.</p><p>We set parameter values P =20 and K=500 for the experiments described in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.6, as a trade-off between accuracy and computational time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Parameter Test: the Number of Basis Function</head><p>In this section we evaluated our method for various number of the basis functions M for the five parametric models so as to find the valid number of the basis functions for an accurate reconstruction.</p><p>The results are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. It is observed that the accuracy converges with the number of basis functions M beyond ten. Thus, we set M to ten in our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3.">Evaluation with Parametric BRDF</head><p>To check if the basis functions we trained by using the MERL database were useful in other applications, together with the dependency on the number of input images, we <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">1</ref> The concrete forms and parameter values of these models are the same as in the experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref>. Please refer their supplementary material. tested our method with various images rendered via parametric BRDF models. In this experiment we compared our method with those in Sato2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref>, Lu2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref>, and Lu2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">2</ref> Here, we used results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref> as the initial estimations of the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref>. Because <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref> does not work well with a Lambertian-like BRDF, they proposed a method of skipping such cases (in this case, the Lafortune and Oran-Nayer models). However, for comparison, we tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref> in all cases without skipping. The experimental results are illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 7</ref>. The figure also shows the position of the light sources (in the upper right corner of each bar graph). From these results, it is clear that our method outperformed previous methods in all cases. The MAEs of the other methods are more than 10 degrees in almost all cases because they work well only with lighting sources that are spaced uniformly and widely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4.">Evaluation with MERL BRDFs</head><p>To evaluate our method for various cases, we examined the performance of our method in terms of images rendered by 100 different BRDFs in the MERL database. In this experiment we used 99 BRDFs for PCA, omitting the one which was used as test images (leave-one-out cross valida- tion). In this experiment, our method was compared with those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">2</ref> The experimental results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 8</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref>) and 4.03 • (mean of the eight trials of our method), respectively. Our method outperformed the other methods.</p><p>It is reported that the avarage error of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref> was 4.25 • with 89 images of sphere dataset. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">3</ref> Although it is competitive with ours, their method has the assumptions of the uniform light source positions and the presence of one lighting which is parallel to the viewing vector. We emphasize that our method works well, even with the crude initial estimation and randomly placed light sources, because of our efficient optimization process and fewer assumptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.5.">Evaluation for Calibrated Photometric Stereo</head><p>We evaluated our method for the case when the lighting sources are calibrated. We compared it with a baseline method of Ikehata2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref>, which is a highly accurate method that adopts a purely pixelwise approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">2</ref> Here we used 100 and 300 input images rendered by using five parametric BRDF models. To make a fair comparison, we solved this problem per pixel by solving Eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(11)</ref>, and took the MAEs of the foreground pixels. Instead of using previous methods, we initialized all the surface normals to n = [0, 0, 1] T . We set the parameter values P = 5 and r θn = r φn = 10 • .</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 9</ref>, our method outperformed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref> for four BRDFs except for the Lafortune model with both 100 and 300 images. These results show the approximation Eq. (3) is accurate enough to apply to photometric stereo.</p><p>We also performed an evaluation with 45 images rendered by using 100 MERL BRDFs as Section 6.4. The aver-  age MAEs over 100 BRDFs were 4.79 • (Ikehata2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref>) and 1.32 • (ours), respectively. The detail of this experiment is described in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.6.">Evaluation with Real Image Data</head><p>We conducted experiments for real images. Here we used 50 images of knight, 60 images of alien, and 44 images of fatguy (this dataset is from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref>), illuminated by uncalibrated directional lighting. For every dataset, we adopted the strategy for spatially varying reflectance presented in Section 5. The number of clusters for the albedo grouping and the threshold for shadow removal were selected manually for each dataset.</p><p>Estimated normal maps and the reconstructed meshes are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10</ref>.

This is a derivation of formulating a regression problem based on an imageformation model for non-Lambertian, uncalibrated photometric stereo. We have shown that our method works well for various cases involving isotropic materials. A current limitation is that our method depends on the bias of training database, and we have not performed sufficient tests with measured datasets other than MERL.</p></div>
