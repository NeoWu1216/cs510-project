<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>To simultaneously estimate camera pose and focal length by using n (n ≥ 4) 3D points in the world frame and their image projections is an important problem in geometric computer vision, with widespread applications in camera tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, incremental structure-from-motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and geolocalization using community image collections <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It can be regarded as a natural extension to the classical absolute pose estimation problem with fully known camera calibration parameters, also known as the PnP problem. This extension is of tremendous practical value, since the other intrinsic parameters of modern digital cameras can usually be assumed to be known a priori. For example, the skewness is usually zero and the aspect ratio is one. The principle point lies approximately in the image center.</p><p>Due to its importance, many algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> have been proposed to solve the PnP problem with unknown focal length. Unfortunately, the existing state-ofthe-art solutions for the general n-point case, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, are still not satisfactory in estimation accuracy. The primary reason lies in that their objective functions are built upon some intermediate entities, and some point correspondences are harmfully privileged over the others. Although one can resort to an additional iterative refinement step to improve the estimation accuracy further, the potential risk of running into local minima or wandering around some extreme points justifies some more endeavors in developing an accurate but noniterative solution.</p><p>In this paper, we propose a direct least-squares solution to the PnP problem with unknown focal length in the general n ≥ 4 case. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, our basic idea is to construct a proper objective function with respect to the target variables and extract all its stationary points so as to find the global minimum. However, our solution is quite different from the existing solutions in that (i) the objective function is directly built upon the imaging equation, such that all the 3D-to-2D correspondences are treated with balance, without privileging some points over the remaining, and that (ii) the proposed solution is noniterative, in the sense that the stationary points are retrieved by means of standard eigenvalue factorization and the common iterative refinement step is not needed.</p><p>The proposed solution has linear time complexity, and thus can be used to handle large scale problems. Unlike the existing work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, our solution does not explicitly differentiate planar from nonplanar 3D points, thus is insensitive to 3D point configurations. We have experimentally verified that the proposed solution is more accurate and efficient than the current state-of-the-art solutions, whose accuracy is even comparable to that of the maximum likelihood estimation by minimizing the reprojection error, despite the fact that our cost function is algebraically meaningful only.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Works</head><p>In this section, we review the related works for the classical PnP problem and the extended one with unknown focal length. There are some other works addressing the pose estimation problem with even more unknown variables, such as aspect ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, principle point <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and radial distortion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, which will not be discussed in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Solutions for PnP</head><p>The PnP problem has been extensively studied in both the minimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> and the overconstrained <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> case. The prominent solutions for the general n-point case have been extended to handle the PnP problem with unknown focal length, thus deserve to be carefully reviewed.</p><p>The EPnP solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is the first widely known O(n) method for PnP. Its core idea is to choose four (three in the planar case) control points to represent all 3D points, and build a cost function with respect to (w.r.t.) the coordinates of those control points. A variable lifting strategy is used to find its approximate global minimum, which can be further refined via iterative optimization. Even ignoring the potential convergence issues, the final solution is not very accurate, since the control points are given more weight over the others. In addition to that, to explicitly differentiate planar 3D points from nonplanar ones would cause inaccuracy in the intermediate near-planar case. The RPnP solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> selects two 3D points as the control points, together with which a point triplet is constructed for each of the rest points. The objective function is w.r.t. the depth factors of the two control points, which are therefore privileged. Rather than working on some intermediate entities, the direct least-squares (DLS) solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> directly constructs an objective function on the basis of the projection equation, and retrieves all stationary points via the resultant technique. The OPnP solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> further conquers the degeneracy of rotation parametrization of DLS. Both DLS (when rotation degeneracy does not occur) and OPnP are much more accurate than EPnP and RPnP, since all the point correspondences are treated equally when constructing the cost function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">PnP with Unknown Focal Length</head><p>When the focal length is unknown, there are seven unknown variables, thus requiring at least three and a half image points from four 3D points. Most existing works for this minimal case, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, use four 3Dto-2D point correspondences, and ignore one constraint in the solving process. Recently, Wu <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> proposed an exactly minimal Gröbner basis (GB) solver by using three and a half points, and used the remaining half measurement for outlier removal. This solver is shown to be much faster than the existing 4-point solvers.</p><p>Given four or more points, the PnPf problem with unknown focal length is overconstrained in general. This fact triggered much research interest in developing an efficient and accurate solution for the general n-point case. Choi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> developed a branch-and-bound algorithm for this problem, whose computational speed is not satisfactory. To develop more efficient solutions with linear time complexity, researchers have tried to transplant the core techniques from existing PnP solutions. For example, Penate-Sanchez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and Kanaeva et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> borrowed the idea of virtual control points in EPnP <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, while Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> followed the point triplet technique originated in RPnP <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Unfortunately, the unbalanced cost function in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> leads to inferior noise resilience, and this behavior is emphasized in the more difficult case of unknown focal length. In addition to that, the exhaustive variable lifting technique in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is not effective enough, when the number of points is small (e.g. 4 ≤ n ≤ 5). The error accumulation issue in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> becomes more severe, and one usually has to refine the results via iterative optimization.</p><p>As mentioned above, a direct least-squares solution can significantly improve the estimation accuracy of PnP. This motivates us to develop a DLS solution to the PnP problem with unknown focal length. The challenge lies in that, when the focal length is unknown, it is very difficult to solve the resulting polynomial system so as to find the global minimum. To resolve this issue, we adopt the rotation decomposition recently proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and properly eliminate the variables to build a bivariate objective function, whose stationary points can be easily retrieved via standard eigenvalue factorization. Note that, although we are inspired by the rotation parametrization in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, our methods for variable elimination and polynomial system solving are different.</p></div>

In summary, when using the universal quaternion parametrization for rotation, the solutions assume four-fold symmetry in general, that is, the following quadruplets are equivalent</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">{ f, q 1 , q 2 , q 3 , q 4 }, { f, −q 1 , −q 2 , −q 3 , −q 4 }, {− f, −q 4 , −q 3 , q 2 , q 1 }, {− f, q 4 , q 3 , −q 2 , −q 1 }.</formula><p>Some existing works, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, have tried to exploit such symmetry in the process of developing Gröbner basis solvers. Since it is generally difficult to design symmetric Gröbner basis solvers, we choose instead to eliminate the symmetry by decomposing the rotation and properly handle the resulting parametrization degeneracy and numerical instability.</p><p>When q 2 1 + q 2 4 0, the rotation matrix R(q) can be decomposed into the product of two rotations R(q θ ) and R(q ω ).

Unfortunately, the solver fails to work for any instance arising from a real pose estimation problem. We have found that the reason lies in the fact that the coefficients of our bivariate system are correlated, and the number of solutions is 61, rather than 121.</p><p>Inspired by this observation, we have generated consistent integer coefficients that preserve intrinsic correlations. By using such a consistent instance, we have been able to develop a GB solver, whose elimination template is of size 130×251, while action matrix is of 61×61. This solver takes about 3ms in our setting, which is more than 15 times faster than the polynomial eigenvalue solver. Due to its efficiency, we are going to use the GB solver for all the experiments, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Avoiding (Near-)Degenerate Cases</head><p>Let us recall that the rotation decomposition applies only when q 2 1 + q 2 4 &gt; 0. When q 1 = q 4 = 0, the decomposition is not unique <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In addition, when the magnitude of q 1 and q 4 is much smaller than q 2 and q 3 , to divide q 2 1 + q 2 4 would cause numerical instability.</p><p>Here, we suggest a principled remedy to resolve those two issues on the basis of the following observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> in which diag{1, −1, −1} denotes the 180 degrees rotation around the x-axis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">Rx i = (Rdiag{1, −1, −1}) (diag{1, −1, −1}x i ) =Rx i ,</formula><p>Due to the Hamilton law, the quaternion ofR = Rdiag{1, −1, −1} is [q 2 , −q 1 , −q 4 , q 3 ] T , from which we observe that the location of {q 1 , q 4 } and that of {q 2 , q 3 } are switched. When q 2 1 + q 2 4 is 0 (or close to 0), the decomposition of R is infeasible (or unstable), yet that ofR should be feasible (or stable), since q = [q 1 , q 2 , q 3 , q 4 ] T has unit norm scale. As a result, our strategy to resolve the potential issues of rotation decomposition is to rotate the 3D points around the x-axis by 180 degrees, and solve the whole problem again. Now the computational procedure can be summarized as follows: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Construct and solve the bivariate system in eq.(16) via the GB technique; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. For each real solution of {b, c}, find x and y by solving eq.(13), from which the focal length and rotation can be recovered. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Recover the translation vector by using eq.(11) and eq.(9); (4). Rotate the 3D points around the x-axis by 180 degrees and repeat step (1-3).</p><p>In our implementation, we evaluate the reprojection error of each solution, and choose the one with smallest reprojection error as our final solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experimental Results</head><p>In this section, we compare our direct least-squares solution (referred to as DLSPnPf ) with the state-of-theart solutions, including UPnPf and its iterative variant UPnPf+GN in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, as well as GPnPf and its iterative variant GPnPf+GN <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. To disclose the difference between reprojection error minimization and our minimization criterion in eq.(15), we also minimize the reprojection error and use the solution from DLSPnPf for initialization. This is denoted by Reproj.</p><p>We implement DLSPnPf in MATLAB and use the publicly available source codes of UPnPf, UPnPf+GN, GPnPf and GPnPf+GN. The comparison is conducted on a laptop with a 2.6GHz CPU and 12GB RAM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Synthetic Data</head><p>We synthesize a pinhole camera with zero skew and unit aspect ratio, whose resolution is 800×640 pixels. The principle point is assumed to be at the image cen-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> for near planar point configuration. Ground-truth rotations and translations are generated, which are used to transform the 3D points into the world frame. We evaluate the absolute error (in degrees) for rotation, while the relative error (%) for focal length and translation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Varying Noise Levels</head><p>Here, the number of points is fixed to 10. Zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation δ is added to disturb the image points. We vary the noise level δ from 0.5 to 5 pixels. At each δ, 500 independent trials are conducted, and the median and mean error for rotation, translation and focal length are reported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.1</ref>. We examine the competing solutions under the nonplanar 3D, near planar and planar point configurations. Note that UPnPf+GN is not included in the planar case, since the Gauss-Newton iterative refinement step is not needed there.</p><p>From <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.1</ref>, we can observe that both UPnPf and GPnPf are not sufficiently accurate, and they indeed rely heavily on their respective iterative refinement UPnPf+GN and GPnPf+GN to improve accuracy. In terms of median errors, GPnPf+GN can offer highly accurate estimation, which is usually better than UPnPf+GN. The reason is that the objective function in UPnPf+GN is build upon some virtual control points, and those anchor points give more weights to the minimized cost. However, when observing the mean errors, GPnPf+GN is usually worse than UPnPf+GN, especially for near planar and planar points with high noise levels (δ &gt; 2 pixels). This reveals the fact that GPnPf+GN might get trapped into a poor local minimum from time to time, which is not obvious by examining the median error only. The risk of local minima or even divergence is a common problem in iterative optimization of a nonconvex problem. Fortunately, due to its noniterative nature, DL- SPnPf always has the highest accuracy, irrespective of the point configuration and the error criterion. Its accuracy is even comparable to that of Reproj. This verifies the validity of our derived cost function in eq.(15), although it is algebraically meaningful only. Note that the translation and focal length error for all competing solutions significantly increase under the planar point configuration, which means that translation and focal length are hard to be disambiguated then. This becomes understandable by considering the extreme case that all 3D points lie on a plane that is parallel to the image plane, in which these two components can not be separated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Varying Number of Points</head><p>Now, the noise level δ is fixed to be 2 pixels. Considering that UPnPf does not work with 4 or 5 points, we vary n from 6 to 15. Similarly, we conduct 500 independent tests for each n. The median and mean errors of rotation, translation and focal length are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig.2</ref>. Again, although GPnPf+GN works well in most trials, it occasionally returns poor solutions, as verified by comparing the median and the mean errors. This issue becomes more apparent under the challenging near planar and planar point configurations. Similar to the observations in Sec.5.1.1, DLSPnPf is the most accurate solution in terms of both mean and median errors, and works consistently well under all examined point configurations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Comparison with Minimal Solvers</head><p>Here, we compare DLSPnPf with the state-of-the-art 4point solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (GPnPf (n=4)) and the exactly minimal solver in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> (P3.5Pf ). We randomly generate 4 nonplanar 3D points and corrupt their image projections by zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation from 0 to 5 pixels. For the P3.5Pf solver, we simply ignore the v-axis measurement of the 4th point. The median error among 500 independent trials of rotation and focal length are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.3</ref>. We can observe that DLSPnPf provides more accurate estimation, since all constraints have been utilized in a balanced way. Considering that the minimal solvers are much faster, DLSPnPf in its current form can not replace them in RANSAC-type applications. Instead, due to its accuracy and noniterativeness, DLSPnPf is currently suited . Pose and focal length estimation of a 3D box (1st row) and a planar book cover (2nd row). In each row, the first image is the reference, while the second image is the input. The input image has been augmented by using the projected contour calculated from the pose and focal length parameters of our direct least-squares solution. The third image visualizes the surface of our objective function, while the fourth image shows the intersection of the two derivative polynomials, in which red dots denote stationary points.</p><p>for outlier-free applications, like model-based pose tracking using fiducial markers and pose bundle adjustment, after outliers have been removed via RANSAC or other robust matching techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.4">Numerical Precision</head><p>To verify that our strategy to avoid (near-)degeneracy in rotation decomposition is effective and that our solvers are numerically stable, we randomly synthesize 6000 nondegenerate, near degenerate and degenerate rotations (2000 for each type). We synthesize 10 noise-free points, and measure the log 10 value of the relative error between the estimated focal length and its corresponding ground truth. We also add UPnPf and GPnPf for comparison. The error histogram over all 6000 trials is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig.4</ref>, from which we observe that the numerical precision of our solution with the GB solver, i.e. DLSPnPf-GB, is comparable to those of UPnPf and GPnPf, although it is lower than the polynomial eigenvalue solver DLSPnPf-PE. This verifies the effectiveness of our strategy to avoid rotation degeneracy and the stability of our GB solver to handle high-degree polynomials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.5">Computational Efficiency</head><p>It is easy to verify that the time complexity of DLSPnPf is O(n), because of the matrix multiplication operation in eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Now we compare the running time of competing solutions by varying n from 6 to 4006. For each n, 500 independent trials are conducted, and the mean running time in milliseconds (ms) is reported in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.5</ref>. We can see that</p><p>DLSPnPf is faster than UPnPf and GPnPf, especially when the number of points is large.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Real Images</head><p>We have also evaluated our direct least-squares solution by using real images provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. We assume that the camera has zero-skew, unit aspect ratio and a centered principle point. Some tentative correspondences are established by matching the input image and the reference one. Outliers are removed via RANSAC with a threshold of 2 pixels. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig.6</ref>, we show two representative results of pose and focal length estimation for a box and a planar book cover. Considering that the ground-truth parameters are not provided, we do not conduct quantitative comparison. Instead, we draw the surface of the objective function in eq. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> and the intersection of the two derivative polynomials in eq.(16), from which one can obtain a clearer sense of the difficulty of the problem due to its strong nonconvexity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have developed a direct least-squares solution for the perspective-n-point pose problem of a partially uncalibrated camera with unknown focal length. Unlike existing solutions, which would give more weights to certain anchor points, our cost function is built directly upon the imaging equation, and all point correspondences are treated equally. Our proposed solution is noniterative and insensitive to the 3D point configuration. It can be applied to handle large problems because of its linear time complexity. The proposed solution has proven to be more accurate and efficient than the current state-of-the-art solutions.</p></div>
