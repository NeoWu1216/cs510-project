<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Subspace clustering methods based on ℓ 1 , ℓ 2 or nuclear norm regularization have become very popular due to their simplicity, theoretical guarantees and empirical success. However, the choice of the regularizer can greatly impact both theory and practice. For instance, ℓ 1 regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity (i.e., there are no connections between points from different subspaces) under broad conditions (e.g., arbitrary subspaces and corrupted data). However, it requires solving a large scale convex optimization problem. On the other hand, ℓ 2 and nuclear norm regularization provide efficient closed form solutions, but require very strong assumptions to guarantee a subspace-preserving affinity, e.g., independent subspaces and uncorrupted data. In this paper we study a subspace clustering method based on orthogonal matching pursuit. We show that the method is both computationally efficient and guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity under broad conditions. Experiments on synthetic data verify our theoretical analysis, and applications in handwritten digit and face clustering show that our approach achieves the best trade off between accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, our approach is the first one to handle 100,000 data points.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In many computer vision applications, such as motion segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, hand written digit clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and face clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, data from different classes can be well approximated by a union of low dimensional subspaces. In these scenarios, the task is to partition the data according to the membership of data points to subspaces.</p><p>More formally, given a set of points X = {x j ∈ R D } N j=1 lying in an unknown number n of subspaces {S i } n i=1 of unknown dimensions {d i } n i=1 , subspace clustering is the problem of clustering the data into groups such that each group contains only data points from the same subspace. This problem has received great attention in the past decade and many subspace clustering algorithms have been developed, including iterative, algebraic, statistical, and spectral clustering based methods (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> for a review).</p><p>Sparse and Low Rank Methods. Among existing techniques, methods based on applying spectral clustering to an affinity matrix obtained by solving an optimization problem that incorporates ℓ 1 , ℓ 2 or nuclear norm regularization have become extremely popular due to their simplicity, theoretical correctness, and empirical success. These methods are based on the so-called self-expressiveness property of data lying in a union of subspaces, originally proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. This property states that each point in a union of subspaces can be written as a linear combination of other data points in the subspaces. That is,</p><p>x j = Xc j and c jj = 0, or equivalently X = XC and diag(C) = 0,</p><p>where X = x 1 , . . . , x N ∈ R D×N is the data matrix and C = c 1 , . . . , c N ∈ R N ×N is the matrix of coefficients. While (1) may not have a unique solution for C, there exist solutions whose entries are such that if c ij = 0, then x i is in the same subspace as x j . For example, a point x j ∈ S i can always be written as a linear combination of d i other points in S i . Such solutions are called subspace preserving since they preserve the clustering of the subspaces. Given a subspace preserving C, one can build an affinity matrix W between every pair of points x i and x j as w ij = |c ij |+|c ji |, and apply spectral clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to W to cluster the data.</p><p>To find a subspace preserving C, existing methods regularize C with a norm · , and solve a problem of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C * = arg min C C s.t. X = XC, diag(C) = 0. (2)</formula><p>For instance, the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> uses the ℓ 1 norm to encourage the sparsity of C. Prior work has shown that SSC gives a subspace-preserving solution if the subspaces are independent <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, or if the data from different subspaces satisfy certain separation conditions and data from the same subspace are well spread out <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Similar results exist for cases where data is corrupted by noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Other selfexpressiveness based methods use different regularizations on the coefficient matrix C. Least squares regression (LSR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> uses ℓ 2 regularization on C. Low rank representation (LRR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> and low rank subspace clustering (LRSC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> use nuclear norm minimization to encourage C to be low-rank. Based on these, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> study regularizations that are a mixture of ℓ 1 and ℓ 2 , and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> propose regularizations that are a blend of ℓ 1 and the nuclear norm.</p><p>The advantage of ℓ 2 regularized LSR and nuclear norm regularized LRR and LRSC over sparsity regularized SSC is that the solution for C can be computed in closed form from the SVD of the (noiseless) data matrix X, thus they are computationally more attractive. However, the resulting C is subspace preserving only when subspaces are independent and the data is uncorrupted. Thus, there is a need for methods that both guarantee a subspace-preserving affinity under broad conditions and are computationally efficient. Paper Contributions. In this work we study the selfexpressiveness based subspace clustering method that uses orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) to find a sparse representation in lieu of the ℓ 1 -based basis pursuit (BP) method. The method is termed SSC-OMP, for its kinship to the original SSC, which is referred to as SSC-BP in this paper.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are to find theoretical conditions under which the affinity produced by SSC-OMP is subspace preserving and to demonstrate its efficiency for large scale problems. Specifically, we show that:</p><p>1. When the subspaces and the data are deterministic, SSC-OMP gives a subspace-preserving C if the subspaces are independent, or else if the subspaces are sufficiently separated and the data is well distributed.</p><p>2. When the subspaces and data are drawn uniformly at random, SSC-OMP gives a subspace-preserving C if the dimensions of the subspaces are sufficiently small relative to the ambient dimension by a factor controlled by the sample density and the number of subspaces. 3. SSC-OMP is orders of magnitude faster than the original SSC-BP, and can handle up to 100,000 data points.</p><p>Related work. It is worth noting that the idea of using OMP for SSC had already been considered in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The core contribution of our work is to provide much weaker yet more succinct and interpretable conditions for the affinity to be subspace preserving in the case of arbitrary subspaces. In particular, our conditions are naturally related to those for SSC-BP, which reveal insights about the relationship between these two sparsity-based subspace clustering methods. Moreover, our experimental results provide a much more detailed evaluation of the behavior of SSC-OMP for large-scale problems. It is also worth noting that conditions under which OMP gives a subspace-preserving representation had also been studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Our paper presents a much more comprehensive study of OMP for the subspace clustering problem, by providing results under deterministic independent, deterministic arbitrary and random subspace models. In particular, our result for deterministic arbitrary models is much stronger than the main result in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p></div>

However, results from compressed sensing do not apply to the subspace clustering problem because when the columns of X lie in a union of subspaces the solution for C need not be unique (see Section 3 for more details).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Theoretical Analysis of SSC-OMP</head><p>OMP has been shown to be effective for sparse recovery, with the advantage over BP that it admits simple, fast implementations. However, note that existing conditions for the correctness of OMP for sparse recovery are too strong for the subspace clustering problem. In particular, note that the matrix X need not satisfy the mutual incoherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> or restricted isometry properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, as two points in a subspace could be arbitrarily close to each other. More importantly, these conditions are not applicable here because our goal is not to recover a unique sparse solution. In fact, the sparse solution is not unique since any d i linearly independent points from S i can represent a point x j ∈ S i . Therefore, there is a need to find conditions under which the output of OMP (which need not coincide with the solution of (6) or <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref>) is guaranteed to be subspace preserving.</p><p>This section is devoted to studying sufficient conditions under which SSC-OMP gives a subspace-preserving representation. Our analysis assumes that the data is noiseless. The termination parameters of Algorithm 1 are ǫ = 0 and k max large enough (e.g., k max = M ). We also assume that the columns of X are normalized to unit ℓ 2 norm. To make our results consistent with state-of-the-art results, we first study the case where the subspaces are deterministic, including both independent subspaces as well as arbitrary subspaces. We then study the case where both the subspaces and the data points are drawn at random.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Independent Deterministic Subspace Model</head><p>We first consider the case where the subspaces are fixed, the data points are fixed, and the subspaces are independent.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Definition 2. A collection of subspaces {S i } n i=1 is called independent if dim i S i = i dim(S i ), where i S i is defined as the subspace { i x i : x i ∈ S i }.</formula><p>Notice that two subspaces are independent if and only if they are disjoint, i.e., if they intersect only at the origin. However, pairwise disjoint subspaces need not be independent, e.g., three lines in R 2 are disjoint but not independent. Notice also that any subset of a set of independent subspaces is also independent. Therefore, any two subspaces in a set of independent subspaces are independent and hence disjoint. In particular, this implies that if</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">{S i } n i=1 are inde- pendent, then S i and S (−i) := m =i S m are independent.</formula><p>To establish conditions under which SSC-OMP gives a subspace-preserving affinity for independent subspaces, it is important to note that when computing OMP(X −j , x j ), the goal is to select other points in the same subspace as x j . The process for selecting these points occurs in step 3 of Algorithm 1, where the dot products between all points x m , m = j, and the current residual q k are computed and the point with the highest product (in absolute value) is chosen. Since in the first iteration the residual is q 0 = x j , we could immediately choose a point x m in another subspace whenever the dot product of x j with a point in another subspace is larger than the dot product of x j with points in its own subspace. What the following theorem shows is that, even though OMP may select points in the wrong subspaces as the iterations proceed, the coefficients associated to points in other subspaces will be zero at the end. Therefore, OMP (with ǫ = 0 and k max = N − 1) is guaranteed to find a subspace-preserving representation.</p><p>Theorem 1. If the subspaces are independent, OMP gives a subspace-preserving representation of each data point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proof. [Sketch only]</head><p>Assume that x j ∈ S i . Since ǫ = 0 and k max is large, OMP gives an exact representation, i.e., x j = Xc j and c jj = 0. Thus, since S i and S (−i) are independent, the coefficients of data points in S (−i) must be zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Arbitrary Deterministic Subspace Model</head><p>We will now consider a more general class of subspaces, which need not be independent or disjoint, and investigate conditions under which OMP gives a subspace-preserving representation. In the following, X i ∈ R D×Ni denotes the submatrix of X containing the points in the ith subspace; for any x j ∈ S i , X i −j ∈ R D×(Ni−1) denotes the matrix X i with the point x j removed; X i and X i −j denote respectively the set of vectors contained in the columns of X i and X i −j . Now, it is easy to see that a sufficient condition for OMP(X −j , x j ) to be subspace preserving is that for each k in step 3 of Algorithm 1, the point that maximizes the dot product lies in the same subspace as x j . Since q 0 = x j and q 1 is equal to x j minus the projection of x j onto the subspace spanned by the selected point, sayx, it follows that if x j ,x ∈ S i then q 1 ∈ S i . By a simple induction argument, it follows that if all the selected points are in S i , then so are the residuals {q k }. This suggests that the condition for OMP(X −j , x j ) to be subspace preserving must depend on the dot products between the data points and a subset of the set of residuals (the subset contained in the same subspace as x j ). This motivates the following definition and lemma. </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">W i j := {w = q q 2 : q ∈ Q(X i −j , x j ), q = 0}.<label>(7)</label></formula><p>The set of OMP residual directions associated with the data matrix X i is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">W i := j:xj ∈Si W i j . Lemma 1. OMP gives a subspace-preserving representa- tion for point x j ∈ S i in at most d i iterations if ∀w ∈ W i j max x∈ k =i X k |w ⊤ x| &lt; max x∈X i \{xj } |w ⊤ x|. (8)</formula><p>Proof. [Sketch only] By using an induction argument, it is easy to see that the condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> implies that the sequence of residuals of OMP(X −j , x j ) is the same as that of the fictitious problem OMP(X i −j , x j ). Hence, the output of OMP(X −j , x j ) is the same as that of OMP(X i −j , x j ), which is, by construction, subspace-preserving.</p><p>Intuitively, Lemma 1 tells us that if the dot product between the residual directions for subspace i and the data points in all other subspaces is smaller than the dot product between the residual directions for subspace i and all points in subspace i other than x j ∈ S i , then OMP gives a subspace-preserving representation. While such a condition is very intuitive from the perspective of OMP, it is not as intuitive from the perspective of subspace clustering as it does not rely on the geometry of the problem. Specifically, it does not directly depend on the relative configuration of the subspaces or the distribution of the data in the subspaces. In what follows, we derive conditions on the subspaces and the data that guarantee that the condition in (8) holds. Before doing so, we need some additional definitions.</p><p>Definition 4. The coherence between two sets of points of unit norm, X and Y, is defined as µ(X , Y) = max x∈X ,y∈Y | x, y |.</p><p>The coherence measures the degree of "similarity" between two sets of points. In our case, we can see that the left hand side of (8) is bounded above by the coherence between the sets W i and k =i X k . As per <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, this coherence should be small, which implies that data points from different subspaces should be sufficiently separated (in angle).</p><p>Definition 5. The inradius r(P) of a convex body P is the radius of the largest Euclidean ball inscribed in P.</p><p>As shown in Lemma 2, the right hand side of (8) is bounded below by r(</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">P i −j ), where P i −j := conv ± X i −j</formula><p>is the symmetrized convex hull of the points in the ith subspace other than x j , i.e., X i −j . Therefore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> suggests that the minimum inradius r i := min j r(P i −j ) should be large, which means the points in S i should be well-distributed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">Lemma 2. Let x j ∈ S i . Then, for all w ∈ W i j , we have: max x∈ k =i X k |w ⊤ x| ≤ max k:k =i µ(W i , X k ) ≤ max k:k =i µ(X i , X k )/r i ; max x∈X i \{xj } |w ⊤ x| ≥ r(P i −j ) ≥ r i .<label>(9)</label></formula><p>Proof. The proof can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Lemma 2 allows us to make the condition of Lemma 1 more interpretable, as stated in the following theorem. </p><formula xml:id="formula_13">µ(X i , X k ) &lt; r 2 i .<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Note that points in W i are all in subspace S i , as step 4 of OMP(A := X i −j , b := x j ) has b and P T k+1 b both in S i . The conditions <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref> and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref> thus show that for each subspace S i , a set of points (i.e., X i or W i ) in S i should have low coherence with all points from other subspaces, and that points in X i should be uniformly located in S i to have a large inradius. This is in agreement with the intuition that points from different subspaces should be well separated, and points within a subspace should be well distributed.</p><p>For a comparison of Corollary 1 and Theorem 2, note that due to Lemma 2 condition (10) is tighter than condition (11), making Theorem 2 preferable. Yet Corollary 1 has the advantage that both sides of condition (11) depend directly on the data points in X , while condition (10) depends on the residual points in W i , making it algorithm specific.</p><p>Another important thing to notice is that conditions (10) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> can be satisfied even if the subspaces are neither independent nor disjoint. For example, consider the case where S i S k = 0. Then, the coherence µ(W i , X k ) could still be small as long as no points in W i and X k are near the intersection of S i and S k . Actually, even this is too strong of an assumption since the intersection is a subspace. Thus, x ∈ X k , y ∈ W i could both be very close to the intersection yet have low coherence. The same argument also works for condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Admittedly, under specific distributions of points, it is possible that there exists x ∈ X k and y ∈ W i that are arbitrarily close to each other when they are near the intersection. However, this worst case scenario is unlikely to happen if we consider a random model, as discussed next.</p></div>

It also shows that as the number of subspaces n increases, the factor log N (n, ρ, d) also increases, making the condition more difficult to be satisfied. In terms of the density ρ, it is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that there exists a ρ 0 such that c(ρ) = 1/ √ 8 when ρ &gt; ρ 0 . Then, it is easy to see that when ρ &gt; ρ 0 , the term that depends on ρ is log ρ log N (n,ρ,d) = log ρ log(n(ρd+1)) , which is a monotonically increasing function of ρ. This makes the condition easier to be satisfied as the density of points in the subspaces increases. Moreover, the probability of success is 1 − 2d N (n,ρ,d) − N (n, ρ, d)e − √ ρd , which is also an increasing function of ρ when ρ is greater than a threshold value. As a consequence, as the density of the points increases, the condition in Theorem 3 becomes easier to satisfy and the probability of success also increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Relationships with Other Methods</head><p>In this section we compare our results for SSC-OMP with those for other methods of the general form in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. These methods include SSC-BP <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, which uses the ℓ 1 norm as a regularizer, LRR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and LRSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which use the nuclear norm, and LSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> which uses the ℓ 2 norm. We also compare our results to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for SSC-OMP. The comparison is in terms of whether the solutions given by these alternative algorithms are subspace-preserving. Independent Subspaces. Independence is a strong assumption on the union of subspaces. Under this assumption, a subspace has a trivial intersection with not only every other subspace, but also the union of all other subspaces. This case turns out to be especially easy for a large category of self-expressive subspace clustering methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and SSC-BP, LRR, LRSC and LSR are all able to give subspacepreserving representations. Thus, in this easy case, the proposed method is as good as state-of-the-art methods. Arbitrary Subspaces. To the best of our knowledge, when the subspaces are not independent, there is no guarantee of correctness for LRR, LRSC and LSR. For SSC-BP, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the representation is subspace-preserving if ∀i = 1, . . . , n, max</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">k:k =i µ(V i , X k ) &lt; r i ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where V i is a set of N i dual directions associated with X i . When comparing (13) with our result in condition <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(10)</ref>, we can see that the right hand sides are the same. However, the left hand sides are not directly comparable, as no general relationship is known between the sets V i and W i . Nonetheless, notice that the number of points in these two sets are not the same since card(V i ) = N i and card(W i ) = N i d i . Therefore, if we assume that the points in V i and W i are distributed uniformly at random on the unit sphere, then µ(W i , X k ) is expected to be larger than µ(V i , X k ), making the condition for SSC-OMP less likely to be satisfied than that for SSC-BP. Now, when comparing (13) with our condition in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">(11)</ref>, we see that the left hand sides are comparable under a random model where both V i and X i contain N i points. However, the right hand side is r 2 i , which is less than or equal to r i since the data are normalized and r i ≤ 1. This again makes the condition for SSC-OMP more difficult to hold than that for SSC-BP. However, this difference is expected to vanish for large scale problems, and SSC-OMP is computationally more efficient, as we will see in Section 5. Random Subspaces. For the random model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> shows that SSC-BP gives a subspace-preserving representation with probability p &gt; 1 −  <ref type="figure">N (n, ρ, d)</ref> .</p><p>If we compare this result with that of Theorem 3, we can see that the condition under which both methods succeed with high probability is exactly the same. The difference between them is that SSC-BP has a higher probability of success than SSC-OMP when d &gt; 1. However, it is easy to see that the difference in probability goes to zero as the density ρ goes to infinity. This means that the performance difference vanishes as the scale of the problem increases.</p><p>Other Results for SSC-OMP. Finally, we compare our results with those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for SSC-OMP. Define the principal angle between two subspaces S i and S k as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">θ * i,k = min x∈Si x 2 =1 min y∈S k y 2 =1 arccos x, y .<label>(15)</label></formula><p>It is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that the output of SSC-OMP is subspacepreserving if for all i = 1, . . . , n,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">max k:k =i µ(X i , X k ) &lt; r i − 2 1 − (r i ) 2 4 √ 12 max k:k =i cos θ * i,k . (16)</formula><p>The merit of this result is that it introduces the subspace angles in the condition, and satisfies the intuition that the algorithm is more likely to work if the subspaces are far apart from each other. However, the RHS of the condition shows an intricate relationship between the intra-class property r i and the inter-class property θ * i,k , which greatly complicates the interpretation of the condition. More importantly, as is shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, the condition is more restrictive than (10), which makes Theorem 2 a stronger result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we first verify our theoretical results for SSC-OMP and compare them with those for SSC-BP by doing experiments on synthetic data using the random model. Specifically, we show that even if the subspaces are not independent, the solution of OMP is subspace-preserving with a probability that grows with the density of data points. Second, we test the performance of the proposed method on clustering images of handwritten digits and human faces, and conclude that SSC-OMP achieves the best trade off between accuracy and efficiency. Methods. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art spectral subspace clustering methods, including LRSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, SSC-BP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, LSR <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and spectral curvature clustering (SCC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In real experiments, we use the code provided by the respective authors for computing the representation matrix C * , where the parameters are tuned to give the best clustering accuracy. We then apply the normalized spectral clustering in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> to the affinity |C * | + |C * ⊤ |, except for SCC which has its own spectral clustering step. Metrics. We use two metrics to evaluate the degree to which the subspace-preserving property is satisfied. The first one is a direct measure of whether the solution is subspace preserving or not. However, for comparing with state of the art methods whose output is generally not subspace preserving, the second one measures how close the coefficients are from being subspace preserving.</p><p>-Percentage of subspace-preserving representations (p%): this is the percentage of points whose representations are subspace-preserving. Due to inexactness in the solvers, coefficients with absolute value less than 10 −3 are considered zero. A subspace-preserving solution gives p = 100.</p><p>-Subspace-preserving representation error (e%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>: for each c j in (1), we compute the fraction of its ℓ 1 norm that comes from other subspaces and then average over all j, i.e., e = 100</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">N j (1− i (ω ij ·|c ij |)/ c j 1 ), where ω ij ∈ {0, 1}</formula><p>is the true affinity. A subspace-preserving C gives e = 0. Now, the performance of subspace clustering depends not only on the subspace-preserving property, but also the connectivity of the similarity graph, i.e., whether the data points in each cluster form a connected component of the graph.</p><p>-Connectivity (c): For an undirected graph with weights W ∈ R N ×N and degree matrix D = diag(W · 1), where 1 is the vector of all ones, we use the second smallest eigenvalue λ 2 of the normalized Laplacian L = I − D −1/2 W D −1/2 to measure the connectivity of the graph; λ 2 is in the range [0, n−1 n ] and is zero if and only if the graph is not connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. In our case, we compute the algebraic connectivity for each cluster, λ i 2 , and take the quantity c = min i λ i 2 as the measure of connectivity. Finally, we use the following two metrics to evaluate the performance of subspace clustering methods.</p><p>-Clustering accuracy (a%): this is the percentage of correctly labeled data points. It is computed by matching the estimated and true labels as a = max π 100 N ij Q est π(i)j Q true ij , where π is a permutation of the n groups, Q est and Q true are the estimated and ground-truth labeling of data, respectively, with their (i, j)th entry being equal to one if point j belongs to cluster i and zero otherwise.</p><p>-Running time (t): for each clustering task using R Matlab.</p><p>The reported numbers in all the experiments of this section are averages over 20 trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Synthetic Experiments</head><p>We randomly generate n = 5 subspaces each of dimension d = 6 in an ambient space of dimension D = 9. Each subspace contains N i = ρd sample points randomly generated on the unit sphere, where ρ is varied from 5 to 3,333, so that the number of points varies from 150 to 99,990. For SSC-OMP, we set ǫ in Algorithm 1 to be 10 −3 and k max to be d = 6. For SSC-BP we use the ℓ 1 -Magic solver. Due to the computational complexity, SSC-BP is run for ρ ≤ 200.</p><p>The subspace-preserving representation percentage and error are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1(a) and 1(b)</ref>. Observe that the probability that SSC-OMP gives a subspace-preserving solution grows as the density of data point increases. When comparing with SSC-BP, we can see that SSC-OMP is outperformed. This matches our analysis that the condition for SSC-OMP to give a subspace-preserving representation is stronger (i.e., is more difficult to be satisfied).</p><p>From a subspace clustering perspective, we are more interested in how well the method performs in terms of clustering accuracy, as well as how efficient the method is in terms of running time. These results are plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  1</ref>(d) and 1(e), together with the connectivity 1(c). We first observe that SSC-OMP does not have as good a connectivity as SSC-BP. This could be partly due to the fact that it has fewer correct connections in the first place as shown by the subspace-preserving percentage. For clustering accuracy, SSC-OMP is also outperformed by SSC-BP. This comes at no surprise as the sparse representations produced by SSC-OMP are not as subspace-preserving or as well connected as those of SSC-BP. However, we observe that as the density of data points increases, the difference in clustering accuracy also decreases, and SSC-OMP seems to achieve arbitrarily good clustering accuracy for large N . Also, it is evident from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref>(e) that SSC-OMP is significantly faster: it is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude faster than SSC-BP when clustering 6,000 points. We conclude that as N increases, the difference in clustering accuracy between SSC-OMP and SSC-BP reduces, yet SSC-OMP is significantly faster, which makes it preferable for large-scale problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Clustering Images of Handwritten Digits</head><p>In this experiment, we evaluate the performance of different subspace clustering methods on clustering images of handwritten digits. We use the MNIST dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which contains grey scale images of handwritten digits 0 − 9.</p><p>In each experiment, N i ∈ {50, 100, 200, 400, 600} randomly chosen images for each of the 10 digits are chosen. For each image, we compute a set of feature vectors using a scattering convolution network <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The feature vector is a concatenation of coefficients in each layer of the network, and is translation invariant and deformation stable. Each feature vector is of size 3,472. The feature vectors for all images are then projected to dimension 500 using PCA. The subspace clustering techniques are then applied to the projected features. The results are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>The numbers show that both SSC-OMP and SSC-BP give a much smaller subspace-preserving representation error than all other methods, with SSC-BP being better than SSC-OMP. This is consistent with our theoretical analysis as there is no guarantee that LSR or LRSC give a subspacepreserving representation for non-independent subspaces, and SSC-BP has a higher probability of giving a subspacepreserving representation than SSC-OMP.</p><p>In terms of clustering accuracy, SSC-OMP is better than SSC-BP, which in turn outperforms LSR and LRSC, while Considering the running time of the methods, SSC-BP requires much more computation, especially when the number of points is large. Though SSC-OMP is an iterative method, its computation time is about twice that of LSR and LRSC, which have closed form solutions. This again qualifies the proposed method for large scale problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Clustering Face Images with Varying Lighting</head><p>In this experiment, we evaluate the performance of different subspace clustering methods on the Extended Yale B dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which contains frontal face images of 38 individuals under 64 different illumination conditions, each of size 192 × 168. In this case, the data points are the original face images downsampled to 48 × 42 pixels. In each experiment, we randomly pick n ∈ {2, 10, 20, 30, 38} individuals and take all the images (under different illuminations) of them as the data to be clustered.</p><p>The clustering performance of different methods is reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. In terms of subspace-preserving recovery, we can observe a slightly better performance of SSC-BP over SSC-OMP in all cases. The other three methods have very large subspace-preserving representation errors especially when the number of subjects is n ≥ 10. In terms of clustering accuracy, all methods do fairly well when the number of clusters is 2 except for SCC, which is far worse than the others. As the number of subjects increases from 10 to 38, LSR and LRSC can only maintain an accuracy of about 60% and SCC is even worse, but SSC-OMP and SSC- BP maintain a reasonably good performance, although the accuracy also degrades gradually. We can see that SSC-BP performs slightly better when the number of subjects is 2 or 10, but SSC-OMP performs better when n &gt; 10.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We studied the sparse subspace clustering algorithm based on OMP. We derived theoretical conditions under which SSC-OMP is guaranteed to give a subspacepreserving representation. Our conditions are broader than those of state-of-the-art methods based on ℓ 2 or nuclear norm regularization, and slightly weaker than those of SSC-BP. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets showed that SSC-OMP is much more accurate than state-ofthe-art methods based on ℓ 2 or nuclear norm regularization and about twice as slow. On the other hand, SSC-OMP is slightly less accurate than SSC-BP but orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time subspace clustering experiments on 100,000 points, whereas state-of-the-art methods had previously only been tested on at most 10,000 data points. Overall, SSC-OMP provided the best accuracy versus computation trade-off for large scale subspace clustering problems. We note that while the optimization algorithm for SSC-BP in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is inefficient for large scale problems, our most recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> presents a scalable algorithm for elastic net based subspace clustering.
